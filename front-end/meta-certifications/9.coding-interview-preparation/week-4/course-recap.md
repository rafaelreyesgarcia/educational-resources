# course recap

## module 1

using appropriate tools is best practice.

always take into account time constraints.

STAR method

- situation (project and challenges)
- task (responsabilities and assignments)
- action (actions required to solve challenges)
- result (outcome of actions)

pseudocode is a good way to explain a a design or pattern without being too technical.

overview of binary (base 10 and base 2)

**positional notation** use of the position of the number to denote a progressive increase (1.00, 10.00, 100.00, 1000.00)

key components of computer memory
- cache
- main
- secondary

**transfer rate** speed at which a computer can transfer memory into the cache.

**time complexity**

evaluate time efficiency and gauge performance by the time taken to complete a task

Big-O notation is a metric to determine an algorithm's efficiency

**space complexity** space required to compute a result.

how much memory a given solution will use?

## module 2

**data structures**

linea data structures

simple
- strings
- booleans

- arrays (static data structure)

dynamic data structure
- queue
- stack
- linked list

non-linear data structures (advanced)
- heaps
- graphs

# course quiz

1. Where would you most likely to be asked a series of coding related questions?

Your technical interview

2. How do computers store and represent information?
Binary

3. If an array of size 5, takes 5 computations before completing. It can be said that this has a Big-O of

O(n)

4. Space complexity is more concerned with

how much space a program takes.

5. What does it mean to say that an array is zero-based?

That the index count starts at 0.

Zero-based refers to the first number of the index. Some languages will start at 1, while others (referred to as zero-based) prefer to start the count at 0.

6. What is the mathematical process for calculating all possible binary permutations called?

Exponentiation

This is the practice of raising a value to the power and it determines how many possible representations a binary number can have.

7. In relation to coding what is modularization?

Wrapping the code into a function means that you can call it repeatedly in your code.

Some code gets used repeatedly, wrapping it in a function for repeated calls is a good time saving technique.

8. Which of the following are actual data structures?

The meaning of the B is not known but some suggestions are balanced, boeing or binary.

9. What are collection classes?

Specialized classes for data storage and retrieval.

They reflect a suite of data structures that act in unique ways and as such can be more suited to a given problem.

10. The knapsack problem is an analogy to demonstrate which task in programming?

Handling CPU loads.

11. If an application returned a result after one computation it ran in:

O(1)

This means that it returns after the first check.

12. What is auxiliary space?

Additional space required to make computations.

13. In relation to data structures mutability refers to:

Whether a structure can be changed after its completion.

Mutability refers to an objectâ€™s ability to change once it has been instantiated.

14. Which of the following statements is true?

LinkedLists can grow without having to copy their values when expanding.

15. What is in-place swapping?

Swapping items in an array in place instead of creating a new structure.

This saves space by not having to create new variables.

16. The process of storing results for later look up to save computation time is an example of what?

Memoization
