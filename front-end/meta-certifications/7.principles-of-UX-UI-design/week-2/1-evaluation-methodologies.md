# evaluating design

lear to describe popular evaluation methodologies in UX and UI design.

some designs are subjective.

there are rules to follow in subjective designs.

a sign-up form can function beautifully, without having a beautiful design.

a beautiful design can function horribly. 

> functionality should always be prioritized over asthetics.

# evaluation cheat sheets

## dieter ram's 10 principles of good design

**1. innovative**
- developing new ideas
- making improvements to existing designs
- use new technologies

**2. makes a product useful**
- designs have a purpose and need to solve a problem

**3. is asthetic**
- beauty makes us feel comfortable
- if a product is beautiful, we might want it more

**4. makes a product understandable**
- should be intuitive and self-explanatory
- communicates instructions easily

**5. unobtrusive**
- over-design products are obtrusive

**6. honest**
- doesn't pretend to be something else
- doesn't promise what it can't deliver
- doesn't lie about the product

**7. long-lasting**
- should avoid being fashionable
- should never appear old or antiquated

**8. detail-oriented**
- leaves nothing out
- every aspect is considered

**9. environmentally friendly**
- designs shouldn't be wasteful and pollute
- should save resources (both physically and digitally)

**10. minimal**
- design should be intentional.

## jakob nielsen's heuristics 10 usability principles to improve UI design

**1. visibility of system status**
- the system should communicate its status and assist users in making informed decisions by using signs, icons. indicators (smartphone's battery, wifi connection, notification, missed calls, etc)

**2. match between system and the real world**
- help users overcome their initial discomfort by using a familiar language instead of technical

**3. user control and freedom**
- users select system functions by accident and need a way to free themselves.
- undo and redo functions.

**4. consistency and standards**

**5. error prevention**
- careful design aims to prevent any possible error to occur. 

**6. recognition rather than recall**
- allow users to recognize information in the UI rather than relying on their recall ability.

**7. flexibility and efficiency of use**
- both experienced and inexperienced users should be able to use a system.

**8. aesthetic and minimalistic design**
- first 50 milliseconds spent on a landing page are crucial to establish a first impression.

**9. help user recognize diagnose and recover from errors**
- good error messages should be polite, easy to understand, precise, constructive, visible and instruct a the best path to fix a problem.

**10. help and documentation**
- documentation is still needed to explain the system easily and focused.

## ben shneidermann's 8 golden rules of interface design

**1. consistency**
- maintains uniformity.
- establishes an identity.

**2. shortcuts**
- add features for advanced and novice users.
- keyboard shorcuts or macro-capabilities.

**3. informative feedback**
- provide feedback asap when users complete activities

**4. dialog to yield closure**
- all interactions must have a start, middle and end.
- guide the user through all the steps informatively.

**5. simple error handling**
- eliminate as many erros as possible.
- the system should make it easy to solve a problem.

**6. easy reversal of actions**
- undo and redo uptions should be available.

**7. support internal locus of control**
- avoid suprises, interruptions or anything the user didn't request to avoid making them feel out of control of the interface.
- users should initiate actions.

**8. reduce short-term memory load**
- make them recognize information rather than recall it.
- keep consistency, simpleness, patterns, standards and conventions.

# designing for accessibility

enables people with disabilities to
- interpret
- understand
- navigate
- interact
- contribute online 

guideline to meet **section 508 and web content accessibility guidelines 2.0** minimum standards

https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/

## access to information is not a barrier to innovation

accessibility may set constraints to consider in design.

constraints offer new ideas to innovate.

accessibility doesn't prevent innovation, in fact it can encourage it.

main focus is to facilitate disabled people to use the interface just as much as a user without any disability.

## don't use color alone to convey information

people who are color blind have low vision or are blind.

> if colors distinguish elements, provide additional identification that isn't dependent on color perception.

required fields can include an asterisk in addition to color and labels.

## provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background

text on
- images
- gradient backgrounds
- buttons
- others

doesn't apply to
- logos
- incidental text (found in a photograph)

a contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1 is recommended.

minimum drop to 3:1 if font is at least 24px or 19px and bold.

## ensure interactive elements are easily identifiable

interactive element styles and naming should be consistent

> its critical that users can use the keyboard to access interactive elements and that is clear which elements are interactive.

border or highlight that moves could indicate visible keyboard focus.

## ensure form elements include clearly associated lables

each field needs a descriptive label except checkboxes and radio buttons.

## navigation options clear and consistent

navigation across pages on a website should be consistent

site search or a site map provides more than one way to nagivate websites.

orientation cues
- breadcrumbs
- clear headings

help understand where they are in the website.

## easily identifiable feedback

form submissions and error notifications are valuable.

if they are instructions, they should be clear.

## headings and spacing to group related content

whitespace and proximity help to highlight relationships between content.

## design for different viewport sizes

## provide controls for content that starts automatically

allow users to stop animations, sounds, videos, ads with visible controls.

good for
- carousels
- image sliders
- background music
- background videos

# excercise: heuristic evaluation

severity raiting 

- s0 - violates heuristic but doesn't have a usability issue
- s1 - cosmetic usability issues easily fixable.
- s2 - minor usability issues might become challenging to solve
- s3 - major usability issues occur frequently.
- s4 - usability issues seriously impairs the use of the product.

easy to fix rating

- e0 - fix will require maximum effort. Solution might not be understood.
- e1 - fix will require considerable effort. solution might not be easy but is understood.
- e2 - fix will require a concentrated effort. solution is not difficult to implement with the proper steps.
- e3 - single developer with minor effort can complete the fix.
- e4 - fix is trival and easy to implement

# knowledge check: heuristic evaluation

1. Visibility of system status means the website informs the user of what is going on through constructive, appropriate and timely feedback. **true**

Visibility of system status means the website informs the user of what is going on through constructive, appropriate and timely feedback.

2. Nielsen’s heuristic number 2: Match between the system and the real world. This heuristic means concepts, words, symbols, situations or actions refer to the same thing. **false**

This refers to Heuristic number 4: Consistency and Adherence to Standards.

3. “Do similar items interact and behave in the same way?” fit into Heuristics number 6, Recognition rather than recall? **yes**

The user does not need to recall information from one part of a dialogue to another.

# knowledge check: evaluation methods

1. Who wrote the 10 Principles of Good Design?
**dieter rams**

2. Accessibility enables people with disabilities to interpret, understand, navigate, interact with and contribute to the web. **true**

3. Are there any guidelines that could help you design your product for accessibility? **yes**

You can implement Section 508 and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 minimum standards. These guidelines cover the significant points you need to know for your products to be accessible to all users.

4. Which of the following is one of Nielsen's ten usability heuristics?

**Flexibility and efficiency of use**

5. Is it critical that users can use the keyboard to access all interactive elements? **yes**

Some users may be unable to use a mouse and rely solely on their keyboard to navigate web pages.
