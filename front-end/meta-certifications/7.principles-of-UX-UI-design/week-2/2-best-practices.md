# form design

forms can be frustrating if not designed with UX in mind.

implement best practices to improve form design and usability.

based on the feedback from previous interviews and observations, the company finds out the need to redesign the form.

suggestions to improve a form
- questions the form refers to should be clear.
- inputs should have enough spacing between each other.
- logical grouping can make the form more understandable.
- there's no way to go back and there's no visibility of system status.
- there's no clue of the form progress. ( a progress indicator should be implemented)
- error handling is not present
- form input should be validated during flow of the form (so the data is validated at time of input)
- language should be clear
- password requirements should be clear and not assume the user knows them.

# components in UI design

a component is any part of a design that can be logically grouped, can be standalone and can be reused.

start small and build components one at a time.

construct a header component that can contain other components, button, search bar, navigation bar, etc. all being standalone units.
