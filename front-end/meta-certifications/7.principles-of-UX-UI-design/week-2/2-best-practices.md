# form design

forms can be frustrating if not designed with UX in mind.

implement best practices to improve form design and usability.

based on the feedback from previous interviews and observations, the company finds out the need to redesign the form.

suggestions to improve a form
- questions the form refers to should be clear.
- inputs should have enough spacing between each other.
- logical grouping can make the form more understandable.
- there's no way to go back and there's no visibility of system status.
- there's no clue of the form progress. ( a progress indicator should be implemented)
- error handling is not present
- form input should be validated during flow of the form (so the data is validated at time of input)
- language should be clear
- password requirements should be clear and not assume the user knows them.

- inline form field validation checks in real time if the input is correct.
- text should be aligned to the left
- unless a legitimate reason, don't request phone numbers
- use browser auto-fill
- mobile-friendly forms
- error messages should be positive

# components in UI design

a component is any part of a design that can be logically grouped, can be standalone and can be reused.

start small and build components one at a time.

construct a header component that can contain other components, button, search bar, navigation bar, etc. all being standalone units.

interchangable blocks that can be assembled and reassembled

**design system**

set of reusable pre made design components and patterns.

similar to a brand style guide.

characteristics of a design system
- design guidelines
- design pattern library
- UI kit 
- process design guidelines

vary from business to business.

**design guidelines** can vary but always will reflect the underlying values of the brand.

a pattern is the recurrence of multiple design elements.

**UI Kit** is a collection of UI focused components.

# knowledge check: best practices

1. Why would you use a progress indicator in form design?
- Users can go back to review the content in case they made a mistake.
- The user can see how many more steps are left to complete on the form.

2. Most websites require that a password consists of a mix of lowercase and capital letters, symbols and numbers. Should you provide clear instructions giving the user immediate feedback on their choice of password?
**You should provide guidance for users to compile their passwords.**

3. Why do you space input fields?
- The user can see that each field is unique.
- To implement logical grouping to make the form more understandable.
- The user can identify the labels that refer to the input

4. A component, such as a button, cannot be reused on a website or an app
**A component is any part of your design that can be logically grouped, which is thought of as stand-alone and can be reused.**

5. Can a header be considered a component? 

Rather than creating the header from scratch for every page, you could construct a "header component" and reuse it.
