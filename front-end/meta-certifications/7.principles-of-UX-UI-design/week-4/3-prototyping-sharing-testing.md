# moving from design to prototyping

create an interactive prototype using a high fidelity design.

prototypes can be animated and shared.

a prototype is an almost working model or mock-up of the product. 

they show how the design will behave once the final product is built.

# micro-interactions and micro-animations

micro-interactions begin with a trigger and progress to a set of instructions represented visually through animations.

the visual output of the micro-interactions is the animation.

micro-animations are individual product moments designed to accomplish a single task while improving the natural product flow.

## micro-interactions

- provide feedback on the outcome of an action
- complete a small task
- increase the feeling of direct manipulation
- assist users in seeing the outcome of their actions
- avoid user errors

examples of micro-interactions
- facebook's like button
- hamburger menu
- pull-to-refresh
- volume control
- auto-complete

design with details have 4 components
- triggers (manual and system)
- rules control micro-interactions
- feedback

## micro-animations

- simple user interfaces
- context and change
- user concentration
- rewards

# module quiz: design and test

1. A brand style guide specifies every aspect of the look and feel of the brand.
**true**

2. What is not included in a brand style guide?
- a design system

Though a design system does contain within it, a brand style guide, the guide itself includes typefaces, color palette and how pictures and images should be used. It also includes a UI Kit, which is a set of files that contains critical UI components like font sizes, icons and documentation.

3. Can you use “fill” to insert an image in Figma?
**true**

4. A story board is a space where designers can freely explore their ideas without judgment at the start of a project. When a board is finished, it serves as a resource for the team throughout the project
**false**

A mood board is a space where designers can freely explore their ideas without judgment at the start of a project. When a board is finished, it serves as a resource for the team throughout the project. 

5. Micro-animations begin with a trigger and progress to a set of instructions represented visually through animations. The visual output of the micro-interaction is animation. 
**false**

Micro-interactions begin with a trigger and progress to a set of instructions represented visually through animations. The visual output of the micro-interaction is animation.

6. What are the benefits of incorporating micro-interactions into a product?
- Provide feedback on the outcome of an action
- Assist users in seeing the outcome of their actions.
- Increase the feeling of direct manipulation.
- Avoiding user errors.
- complete small tasks

7. Micro-animations are very useful for rewarding the user after completing an action, such as submitting a form.
**true**

8. According to research, common patterns for the eye to follow are
- E, Z, F

9. There are abstract elements in a design system.
**true**

10. Can you share your prototype in Figma with your team members and stakeholders?
**yes**
