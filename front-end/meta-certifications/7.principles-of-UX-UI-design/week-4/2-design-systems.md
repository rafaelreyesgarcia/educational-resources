# what are design systems?

differences between design systems and UI kits.

a design system is everything that goes into creating a product
- typography
- colors
- icons
- layoust
- grids
- coding standards
- naming conventions

a design system is a guide on the tone of voice, a style guide and documentation for developers.

ui kit is similar to a design system but limited to elements of a user interface.
- typographic scale
- color system
- buttons, menu items and components

a navigation bar component
- primary navigation of a website
- logo, links and CTA button 
- right of navbar login and signup information
- search option


## atomic design

invented by Brad Frost.

thought process of assembling design elements.

atoms are individual elements like
- text boxes 
- form inputs
- links or buttons

molecules combine atoms together
- input box with a label

organisms are groups of molecules
- navigation bar
- footer
- hero section

templates are low fidelity or basic wireframes that consist of atoms, molecules and organisms together.

this structured and ordered approach is granular.

pages are more specific refinements of templates.

# design systems

- collection of reusable components
- principles and guidelines for consistent product and web design

set of deliverables.

contains both tangible and intangible elements (patterns, components, guidelines)

aligning design teams around a standard set of goals creates shared values.

shared values

**design principles**

guiding sentences to achieve the goal of a product through design.

**brand identity and language**

color, design and logo

**components and patterns**

design system is built around components and patterns.

**patterns** are building instructions.

**components** contains technical and functional documentation.

# design systems in figma

create components and reuse them across the design.

layers or objects can be turned into components.

elements
- buttons
- icons
- layouts

auto-layout and component features in figma

auto-layout resizes the component shape to the size of the text.

a component in figma contains a master and an instance.

3. Material design is the visible elements of a brand, such as color, design and logo, that identify and distinguish the brand in the minds of consumers. Itâ€™s referred to as brand identity. 
**false**

4. **patterns** are the building instructions that allow you to use components logically and consistently across all products.

5. Design principles lay a better foundation and guide a team through the creation and ongoing implementation of a design system. 
**true**
