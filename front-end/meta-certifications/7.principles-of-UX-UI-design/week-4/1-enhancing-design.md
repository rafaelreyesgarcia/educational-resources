# make it beautiful

identify the use of images, colors and shapes and their role in design.

every component of a visual message is essential.

main elements
- line
- text
- color
- shape
- graphic elements ( icons, images, space )

## lines

most fundamental element

can assist directing the eye.

thickness of a line can mean additional information.

design layout can be emphasized with colors and lines.

## type

web typography is not so different to print typography.

graphic elements must be properly balanced digitally
- typeface
- type size
- color
- line height
- letter shapes

## color

can set a mood.

effective tool to develop brand identity and evoking emotions.

RGB and CMYK color schemes are used in design.

RGB in digital, CMYK in print.

color qualities
- hue (how closely or differently a hue is from the rimary colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
- tint (lightness of a color by mixing it with white)
- tone (process of muting a color by adding gray)
- shade (shaded version of a hue by adding black)
- saturation ( intensity of a color, less faded and lighter and more rich and darker)

## shapes

draw attention to a layout

types of shapes
- geometric (accuracy and mathematically structured, squares, circles and triangles)
- organic (lack sharp edges and are smooth and natural)
- abstract (reality is presented minimally.)

logos use abstract shapes to reflect the spirit of the company.

## images

UX can improve by using variety of media elements.

images are practical engaging and simple to memorize.

## space

the area that shapes occupy.

describes the background which the shape is contrasted.

there's positive (Areas of interest) and negative space (space around positive).

elements can be connected or separated using space

narrower spaces link items to show connections

wider gaps divide elements to show separation

link is enhanced by overlapping.

# design elements principles

## lines

linear marks.

can include words, letters that are curved angled or have straight lines.

lines can guide specific ideas.

straight lines can mean order

wavy lines can be mean movement.

zig-zagged lines can mean tension or excitment.

leading lines is a common technique in photography

## scale

deliberate sizing of individual elements in most basic form.

scale doesn't always have to be realistic.

## color

create moods, atmospheres and emotions.

shades have connotations.

## repetition

logo, general tone of voice, color schemes aid to branding

repeting these elements ensures the branding stays consistent

## negative space

space in between an area or around other elements.

## symmetry

humans find symmetry more appealing, effective and beautiful.

symmetry can create a sense of balance and order.

## transparency

opacity refers to how see-through an element is.

## texture

can add tactility, depth and cool effects

## balance

ensures that no element overpowers another

## hierarchy

headings and titles are the most important parts as they are the top of a hierarchical scale.

then sub-headings, pull quotes and additional information.

a pull quote is a small section of text extracted from a source and quoted in a different format.

least amount of visual charm are for elements like
- body copy
- links
- etc

## contrast

degree of difference between two elements of a design.

dark versus light.

thick vs thin.

large vs small

more than just a stylistic element or legibility enhancer.

contrast make designs pop or stand out.

drawing attention to specific elements can be done with a call to action.

## frame

what's included excluded or the way its presented

frame draws attention to the piece and directs the eye to the essential part.

## grid

first essential step in building a website.

indicates where elements should be placed.

## direction

refer to as flow. how will the site direct the eye movement across the elements.

https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content-discovered/

a common pattern of the eye is to follow an E or F.

top content should go to the left or along the top.

Z shape is another common pattern.

general idea is that the eye naturally travels in a sweeping motion from top left to bottom right.

this theory is explained in the gutenberg diagram

## rules

- type must be legible
- adjust kerning
- avoid using pixelated images.

## depth

create a sense of depth and illusion that design extends beyond 2d.

shadows achieve depth.

shadows can be linear, stretch, bend, warp and skew.

overlapping elements can introduce depth.

flat design reduces the amount of depth.

## composition

connects all the other previous elements.

overall arrangement of elements in a design.

# stylize high-fidelity design


steps from wireframe to high-fidelity mockup

a brand style guide must be followed.

this includes (typefaces, color palette, media usage, UI kit)

add styles 

# mood boards in design

combine abstract concepts such as emotions, desires, thoughts.

graphic panels that combine sensory sources to create a dynamic environment as a guide for creative decisions.

photos, colors, illustrations, animations, fonts, textures can be used to develop a mood board.

panels connect ideas.

can be used for
- documentation of research
- designer exploration and guidance
- combining visions

types of mood boards

digitall or physical

process
- recognize the goal
- set the tone
- collect information on the subject
- establish your values
- think big then small
- choose wiselly

# knowledge check - enhancing design

1. Which of these are design elements?
- lines
- negative space
- depth

2. ”Overlapping” refers to the overall arrangement of elements in your design.
**false**

”Composition” refers to the overall arrangement of elements in your design. Overlapping in a composition is how all the elements overlap to create the illusion of a third dimension.

3. Mood boards are graphic panels that combine different sensory sources to create a dynamic environment that acts as a guide for creative decisions

**true**

4. Select all the different types of Mood boards
- digital
- physical

5. What icon in Figma represents the main component?
**four solid diamonds**
