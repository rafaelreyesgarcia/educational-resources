# user experience UX

## what is UX?

how do you feel before, during and after using a product/service?

can user achieve their goals easily from a product/service?

is the interface smooth, enjoyable and makes users feel in control?

why do customers come back?

Don norman coined the term UX

is a product intuitive and enjoyable?

products features have to be discoverable

product design needs to give feedback to users actions

**overview of UX**

iterative (review back a step to keep refining the solution)

- observe a task
- identify problems
- generate ideas
- prototype

UX includes everything related to all interactions a user has with a company, services and products

## UX goals + quality components

not able to easily place an order or reserve a table is a usability issue, not design issue.

align customer goals with business goals

- recognize UX goals
- apply goals to design UX
- identify nielsen's usability quality components

usability gauges how intuitive or easy a product is to use

jacob nielsens proposed 5 quality components of usability
- learnability (how easy it is to learn the process of completing a purchase or action)
- efficiency (how easy it is to perform actions)
- memorability (is it easy to return to the process later?)
- errors (what if the user makes mistakes? do we guide them to fix them?)
- satisfaction

customer goals

the product should be 
- enjoyable
- fun
- intuitive

the product shouldn't be
- slow
- confusing
- complicated

design should be
- relaxing
- satisfying 
- efficient

customer should be 
- engaged
- motivated
- stimulated

customers shouldn't be
- bored
- frustrated
- stressed

issues the customer face

- is a table available? 
- what time can we reserve it for?

issues the design face

- is the information provided to make the user feel supported and empowered (confident)
- is the information clear?
- is the information easy to find to complete user's tasks?

## empathy tools: artifacts in UX process

artifcats are documents that design teams create to gather, organize and present information thorughout UX process.

**user personas**

model or character that portrays a possible user of a website and app.

personas help understand the end user while designing a product.

personas exists since the 90's

essential for user experience/research

personas focus on the target users ensuring the product fits their needs and requirements.

multiple personas can be developed to segment the broad audience that can interact with a website or app.

observing the customer's behavior can help understand the user motivations and design accordingly.

**customer interviews**

once you see no new information is extracted from multiple interviews, is a good indicator you don't need to keep interviewing. 

**market assumptions**

if the product is old, there might be enough information to reasonably assume about customer's behaviors and motivations. up to date research is suggested to continue backing up these assumptions.

**web analytics**

resource for quantitative data. describe how customers behave but not why they behave like that. perfect to understand behavior not motivations.

**create a customer persona group**

once research is complete, divide information into groups to consolidate them further into single-user personas.

concentrate in primary needs of the most important user group.

**persona example**

name, age, gender, ocupation, **extra descriptors**

a phrase that describes the persona in a nutshell,

bio (mini)

*psychological profile*

core needs

frustrations

**user stories**

brief statement or abstract that describes the user and their goals

as a (user) i want ( a goal) for (some reason)

*as an online banking customer i want to add a payee to my account so i can transfer money to that payee*

**scenarios**

situation that depicts how users interact with the website or app.

describe user motivations.

the scenario could describe how the user acomplishes the story.

scenario mapping is the first step in scenario planning.

**storyboards**

visual representation of how a user will interact with a product/service

designers can create different storyboards
- sketches
- illustrations
- screenshots
- slideshows
- animations
- live demos

to create a storyboard set the scene by defining
- persona
- environment
- plot

## overview of the UX process

process driven discipline.

there's no one size fits all approach.

the goal is a rich user experience design.

5 stages of UX process
1. empathize
2. define
3. ideate
4. prototype
5. test

**empathize**

understand the user's needs.

from the results of research, a persona can be created to reference throughout the design process.

create an empathy, map a scenario and journey map to empathize with the persona.

this keeps ideas grounded to avoid making assumptions.

**define**

distill ifnormation collected to identify key problems and needs.

prioritize frustrations or pain points by importance.

a user needs statement outlines the needs users have.

once a problem is established ideating can begin.

**ideate**

generate ideas.

sketch, brainstorm, mind map handwrite notes.

iterate to reflect on the work and improve the design.

ideas for the solution should be developed into wire frames.

**wire frame** 2d representation of the user interface with the placement and hierarchy of functionalities and expected user actions.

**prototype**

simulation of the final product.

iterated and refined ideas into the final solution.

simulate how this solution would work in production.

this stage is also iterable.

**test**

testing the design to get feedback.

then the build stage should ensure the product is built addressing the needs of users while offering a great experience.

## knowledge check: what is UX?

1. UX is an iterative process that solves usability problems. For example, increasing sales and keeping customers coming back for more by examining a website or app from the user’s perspective

**true**

UX is an iterative process that solves usability problems. For example, increasing sales and keeping customers coming back for more by examining a website or app from the user’s perspective.

2. What are the five stages of the UX process? Select all that apply.

**empathize**

This is the first of the five stages in the UX process. The key here is to understand your user’s needs using research.

**define**

This is the second step of the five stages in the UX process, where you identify your users’ critical problems.

**ideate**

This is the third step of the five stages in the UX process, where you generate ideas by sketching, brainstorming, mind-mapping, and even creating hand-written notes.

**prototype**

This is the fourth step of the five stages in the UX process. Here you simulate how your product will work before release.

**test**

This is where your users interact with or test your prototype. Any problems are communicated, and you can then address these issues before building the final product. This is an iterative process.

3. Usability in UX design determines how intuitive a product is to use.

**yes**

4. Jakob Nielsen proposes usability components. What are these usability components? Select all that apply.

**learnability**

The product should immediately be easy to understand and learn.

**efficiency**

The product should act quickly and efficiently should the user choose to make changes while using your product. 

**memorability**

The product should be designed so that if the user gets distracted, it should be easy to remember where they were.

**errors**

The design should provide solutions to mistakes and try to prevent them from happening. 

**satisfaction**

Users should enjoy using your product, and you should keep them engaged and excited.

5. What is a wireframe in UX design? 

It’s a two-dimensional representation of the interface concerned with the placement and hierarchy of content and functionalities offered.
