# wireframing

the purpose of a wireframe is to create a basic structure for each screen.

design branding, colors, images

communicates ideas quickly

skeleton requirements
- little lemon brand
- about and menu categories
- prices
- customize orders
- description and photos of dishes
- delivery or take out options
- number of dishes
- login, pay and nagivation bar


**mobile first design approach**

- most users access the web on a mobile device.
- easier to solve design problems on a small screen then adapt them to a larger one.

first frame
- navigation bar
- about little lemon
- menu categories
- menu dishes

The purpose of a wireframe is to create a basic structure for each screen in the design before things like branding, colors and images are considered. It provides a way of communicating ideas quickly, which can be refined later. You focus on the user experience and on what they need to accomplish a task. 

# rapid prototyping

advantages, cycle, levels of fidelity to use.

before investing time and money developing an idea, it has to be worth implementing and should work as intended.

scale-down version of a product is the prototype

paper models simple, or fully functional digital prototypes that the user can interact with.

rapid prototyping comes from the manufacturing industry.

creates a 3d model of a product before mass production.

rapid prototyping in digital design is the process of iteratively mocking up an interface and validating it with users, stakeholders and teammates.

## advantages

- provide visuals to improve communication
- validate the product is tailoring the user needs. 
- process allows to collect feedback kearly and build a definite product with more certainty.

prototypes can be
- main functions and features
- new interactions and patterns

# usability testing

define usability testing.

usability testing is the process of getting actual people to use a website app or other products.

**facilitator** gives participants tasks, monitor participants behavior and listen to feedback.

quantitative usability testing gather metrics that capture user experience.

tasks, success and time on task are two metrics collected.

different numbers of people are required for usability test.

online testing is popular as person-to-person research is more expensive.

# usability test cheat sheet and template

usability testing is an evaluative user research technique to understand better how people interact with a product.

can be done during design, development or after deployment.

## user interviews

**prior to interview**
- discussion guide to prepare
- interview schedule
- roles and responsabilities
- scenarios list
- test materials (design prototypes, competitor websites, etc)
- reliance on stakeholders
- forms of consent and disclosure
- exit survey (closed-ended questions)

**during interview**
- warm up participants
- open questions to begin with
- task-based questions
- recall a previous experience
- beliefs and attitudes
- inquiry questions
- closing remarks

**after interview**

- debriefing (determines what went well, what can imrpove, prioritized, etc)
- preparation and distribution of topline summary (keeps stakeholders up to date)
- updating the research schedule

## unmoderated usability testing types

unmoderated refers to participants testing the product without being observed.

unmoderation can be done 
- in person
- remote

## conduct unmoderated usability test

define objectives
- what stakeholders want
- how does this benefit the company
- research method appropiate for objectives
- stakeholders in agreement regarding goal statements
- what objectives can be included in future rounds

determine participant profile
- number of targeted profiles and personas
- segmentation
- relevant behavioral attributes
- sample size

screen and shortlist candidates
- prepare a list of screener questions to select candidates
- determine answers that qualify or disqualify participants
- level of comfort in thinking aloud
- include a question to assess the ability of the participant to provide feedback
- collect contact information
- include the incentive
- request consent

choose a platform
- plaftorm compatible?
- capable of attracting participants?
- test material is testable?

gather test materials
- wireframes
- prototypes
- non-disclosure agreement

list of tasks to be completed
- 5 or 7 at the time
- each task corresponds the study's objectives
- tasks must be clearly worded and unambiguous
- clearly defined success criteria
- task flow (sequence in which tasks are presented)

determine usability metrics
- failure or success
- time to complete tasks
- first click or tap
- count clicks and taps
- paths of nagivation
- tasks number of retries

questions to ask after finishing 
- unanswered questions
- single or multiple choice
- likert scale of 5 to 7 points
- matrix or ranking
- inquire about recall, task difficulty addicitonal information

perform test run
- Experimenting with the test yourself, also known as a dry run, helps to refine it. 
- Dry run with internal and external participants 
- Determine whether or not there is a fatigue factor in completing the test. 
- Check to see if everything is working as it should. For example, prototypes are loading correctly and are the correct ones. 
- Fine-tune questions and include information that may have been overlooked. 
- If everything is in order, start the test. 

# self-review: write a usability test

1. Evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users is called usability testing
**true**

Evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users is called usability testing. 

2. Why would you ask your testers warm-up questions when you do a usability test

Establish rapport with the participants.

The warm-up questions help build or establish a rapport with your participants, so they feel comfortable completing the usability test. This also assists with gathering background information about the participants. For example, what type of devices they use, their occupations or their technical literacy.

3. You should conduct a usability test on an uncontrolled basis which allows the user freedom to do what they want with the product they are testing.
**false**

Before conducting a usability test, you should prepare a test script that aligns with your testing objectives. To get the most out of them, you'll need to prepare a proper script and know how to ask good questions.  

## module summary

iterative design
- create wireframes 
- rapid prototyping tools and methods
- usability testing

1. The purpose of a wireframe is to create a basic structure for each screen in the design before things like branding, colors and images are considered. 
**true**

The purpose of a wireframe is to create a basic structure for each screen in the design before things like branding, colors and images are considered. 

2. What is involved in usability testing?
- letter of consent
- tasks
- participants
- test script
- facilitator or researcher

3. Usability testing cannot be done online.
**false**

4. What are the advantages of rapid prototyping?
- Addresses and solves problems
- Provides the user with visuals
- Validates a product section in a relatively short period
- Identifies problems or pain points early in the design process

5. You should not name your layers in Figma.
**false**

The best practice is to name your layers in Figma, as this assists you with organizing and identifying your layers.  Designers are sometimes tempted to leave their layers panel looking like organized chaos, making it difficult to find things. Figma documents can become overly complex, so itâ€™s best to name your layers.

6. Is there a difference between Groups and Frames in Figma?
**yes**

Groups are defined by their contents. Your group's boundaries are the outer edges of whatever is inside. On the other hand, the boundaries of your frame are independent of what's inside.

7. Which of the following are fidelity levels in prototyping?

high, mid and low 

8. Constraints help maintain consistent spacing across different container sizes and configuring resizing behavior

**true**

Constraints help maintain consistent spacing across different container sizes and configuring resizing behavior

9. A grid is the intersection of rows and columns that create units of space. Each design element (text, images or buttons) fits into modules
**false**

A module is the intersection of rows and columns that create units of space. Each design element (text, images or buttons) fits into modules.

10. Which of these elements are included in typography terminology?
**weight, kerning, baseline, cap height**
