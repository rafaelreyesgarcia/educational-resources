# **MANAGING STATE**

## reacting to input with state

instead of manipulating individual pieces of UI, the different states are 'described' and switch between them in response to user input.

how the UI can change in response to user actions
- typing something into a form enables the submit button
- pressing submit disables the submit button and loading spinner appears.
- form is hidden and thank you message appears if successful
- network request fails, an error appears and form becomes enabled to try again.

imperative programming explicitly instructs the UI how to change in response to exact interactions each step on the way.

imperative means to command each element.

imperative state manipulation is fine for isolated components but is exponentially difficult to scale.

in react's declarative approach, you describe what to show, and react figures out how to update the UI.

to understand state
- **identify** component's visual states
- **determine** what triggers those state changes
- **represent** state in memory using `useState`
- **remove** non-essential state variables
- **connect** event handlers to set state

a state machine can be in one of several states.

different states of a UI
- **empty** form with a disabled submit button
- **typing** enabled submit button
- **submitting** for is disabled, spinner is shown
- **success** thank you message is displayed
- **error** comes back to typing state, displaying an error to fix input and try again.

```jsx
// simple state of a react form
export default function Form({
  // empty, submitting, error, success
  status = 'empty'
}) {
  if (status === 'success') {
    return <h1>That's right!</h1>
  }
  return (
    <>
      <h2>city quiz</h2>
      <p>
        in which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form>
        <textarea 
          disabled={
            status === 'submitting'
          }
        />
        <br />
        <button
          disabled={
            status === 'empty' ||
            status === 'submitting'
          }
        > 
          submit
        </button>
        {
          status === 'error' &&
          <p className='error'>
            good guess but a wrong answer, try again!
          </p>
        }
      </form>
    </>
  )
}
```

showing all possible visual states in one page is convenient when fine tuning the component's state visual appearance and logic.

Pages often called living styleguides or storybooks.

```jsx
import Form from './Form.js';

let statuses = [
  'empty',
  'typing',
  'submitting',
  'success',
  'error',
];

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {statuses.map(status => (
        <section key={status}>
          <h4>Form ({status}): </h4>
          <Form status={status}/>
        </section>
      ))}
    </>
  )
}
```

reasons to trigger state changes
- human inputs (clicking a button, typing in a field, navigating a link)
- computer inputs (network response arriving, timeout completing, image loading)

state variables in a form
- text input change (human) switches to **typing**.
- submitting the form (human) switches to **submitting**.
- successful network response (computer) switches to **success**.
- failed network response switches to **error**.

human inputs often require event handlers

state in memory is represented with `useState`

some states are a must

```jsx
// possible states
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
const [error, setError] = useState('null');

const [isEmpty, setIsEmpty] = useState(true);
const [isTyping, setIsTyping] = useState(false);
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);
const [isSuccess, setIsSuccess] = useState(false);
const [isError, setIsError] = useState(false);
```

rules of state variables
- states shouldn't cause a paradox (were both states can't be true or false at the same time)
- `answer.length === 0` removes the need of `isEmpty`, the same information is available in another variable.
- inverting state can avoid duplicating unnecessary states
`isError` is just `error !== null` 

```jsx
// cleaned up state
const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
const [error, setError] = useState(null);
const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing'); // 'typing', 'submitting', 'success'
```

final simple react form

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [answer, setAnswer] = useState('');
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing');

  if (status === 'success') {
    return <h1>that's right!</h1>
  }

  async function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setStatus('submitting');
    try {
      await submitForm(answer);
      setStatus('success');
    } catch (err) {
      setStatus('typing');
      setError(err);
    }
  }

  function handleTextareaChange(e) {
    setAnswer(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>city quiz</h2>
      <p>
        in which city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
      </p>
      <form>
        <textarea 
          value={answer}
          onChange={handleTextareaChange}
          disabled={status === 'submitting'}
        />
        <br />
        <button
          disabled={
            answer.length === 0 ||
            status === 'submitting'
          }
        >
          Submit
        </button>
        {error !== null && (
          <p className='error'>
            {error.message}
          </p>
        )}
      </form>
    </>
  );
}

function submitForm(answer) {
  // simulate an http request, response
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      let shouldError = answer.toLowerCase() !== 'lima';
      if (shouldError) {
        reject(new Error('good guess but wrong answer! Try again...'));
      } else {
        resolve();
      }
    }, 1500);
  })
}
```

expressing interactions as state changes allows to scale interactivity in an app.

## choosing state structure

principles to choose state structure
- group related state (variables that update at the same time can be grouped)
- avoid contradictions in state (paradoxes)
- avoid redundant state (calculate info from props or existing state variable not as a separate component state)
- avoid duplication in state (same data duplicated between state variables or nested objects)
- avoid deeply nested state (flat state structure is preferred)

> make state easy to update without introducing mistakes

group related state variables

```jsx
const [x, setX] = useState(0);
const [y, setY] = useState(0);

// grouped
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0});
```

when using an object as state, all other fields should be copied

```jsx
setPosition({...position, x: 100});
```

### contradiction in state

```jsx
const [text, setText] = useState('');
const [isSending, setIsSending] = useState(false);
const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);

async function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  setIsSending(true);
  await sendMessage(text);
  setIsSending(false);
  setIsSent(true);
}
```

### redundant state

```jsx
function Message({ messageColor }) {
  const [color, setColor] = useState(messageColor);
}
```

state is only initialized during first render, so if the parent component updates `messageColor` the state variable won't update.

mirroring props in a state variable is bad.

mirroring props into state is only useful when ignoring the updates is the desired outcome.

```jsx
function Message({ initialColor }) {
  // The `color` state variable holds the *first* value of `initialColor`.
  // Further changes to the `initialColor` prop are ignored.
  const [color, setColor] = useState(initialColor);
}
```

### duplicated state

```jsx
const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems);
const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = useState(
  items[0]
);
```

instead of `selectedItem` object, hold `selectedId` in state and then get a `selectedItem` by searching items array for an item with that ID.

```jsx
const [items, setItems] = useState(initialItems);
const [selectedId, setSelectedId] = useState(0);

const selectedItem = items.find(item =>
  item.id === selectedId
);
```

### deeply nested state

updating nested states requires making copies of objects recursively. Code can get complex.

flattening state should improve.

## sharing state between components

lifting state up is removing the state of components, moving it up to the closest common parent and then passing down the state via props.

3 steps to lift state up
- remove state from children
- pass hardcoded data from common parent
- add state to common parent and pass it down together with event handlers

common to call a stateful component 'uncontrolled' because the parent elements can't influence their state.

a component is controlled when important information is driven by props rather than local state.

uncontrolled

easier to setup, less flexible to coordinate.

controlled

completely flexible, require parent to fully configure props.
