# **ADDING INTERACTIVITY**

## responding to events

data on the screen can update in response to user input.

data that changes over time is called *state*

you can add state to any component.

adding event handlers to JSX is possible.

event handlers are custom functions to trigger in response to user interactions like
- clicking
- hovering
- focusing on form inputs
- etc

**adding event handlers**

to add an event handler, first define the function and then pass it as prop to a JSX tag.

```jsx
export default function Button() {
  return (
    <button>
      I don't do anything
    </button>
  );
}
```

follow 3 steps to add interactivity to a button
- declare a function `handleClick` inside `Button`
- implement logic inside function (use `alert` to show a message)
- add `onClick={handleClick}` to `<button>` JSX

```jsx
export default function Button() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('You clicked me!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </button>
  );
}
```

event handler functions
- are usually defined inside components
- have names with a `handle` prefix

convention to name event handlers as `handle` followed by event name.

inline event handler in JSX

```jsx
<button onClick={function handleClick() {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>

// using an arrow function
<button onClick={() => {
  alert('You clicked me!');
}}>
```

inline event handlers are common for short functions.

**pitfall**

functions passed to event handlers must be passed, not called.


```jsx
// passing a function
<button onClick={handleClick}>

// calling a function (incorrect)
<button onClick={handleClick()}>
```

passing a function as an event handler tells react to remember it and call it when the user clicks the button

passing a function call invokes it immediately during rendering without any clicks. 

> javascript inside `{}` executes right away.

writing inline code the same pitfall is seen

```jsx
// passing
<button onClick={() => alert('...')}>
// calling
<button onClick={alert('...')}>
```
the function is invoked every time the component renders if you pass a function invocation. The function is stored and later invoked by a user interaction e.g if you pass a function definition(declaration)

**reading props in event handlers**

a button that shows an alert with the `message` prop when clicked

```jsx
function AlertButton({ message, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => alert(message)}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AlertButton message="Playing!">
        Play Movie
      </AlertButton>
      <AlertButton message="Uploading!">
        Upload Image
      </AlertButton>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**passing event handlers as props**

parent component specifies a child's event handler.

depending on where you use a `Button` component, you can execute different functions.

```jsx
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

function PlayButton({ movieName }) {
  function handlePlayClick() {
    alert(`Playing ${movieName}!`);
  }

  return (
    <Button onClick={handlePlayClick}>
      Play "{movieName}"
    </Button>
  );
}

function UploadButton() {
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
      Upload Image
    </Button>
  );
}

export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PlayButton movieName="Kiki's Delivery Service" />
      <UploadButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

`Toolbar` renders `PlayButton` and `UploadButton`

`PlayButton` passes `handlePlayClick` as `onClick` prop to the `Button` inside

`UploadButton` passes an arrow function as the `onClick` prop to the `Button` inside.

`Button` accepts a prop `onClick` it passes the prop directly to the built-in browser `<button>`

following design systems, is common for components like buttons to contain styling but not specify behavior, behavior is passed down from the parent(s).

**naming event handler props**

built-in html elements like `<button>` only support built-in browser events like `onClick`

create own components and give their event handler props any name.

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <Toolbar
      onPlayMovie={() => alert('Playing!')}
      onUploadImage={() => alert('Uploading!')}
    />
  );
}

function Toolbar({ onPlayMovie, onUploadImage }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button onClick={onPlayMovie}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={onUploadImage}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}

function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

**event propagation**

event handlers can catch events from any children the component might have.

the event *bubbles* or *propagates* up the tree.

```jsx
export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div className="Toolbar" onClick={() => {
      alert('You clicked on the toolbar!');
    }}>
      <button onClick={() => alert('Playing!')}>
        Play Movie
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
        Upload Image
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> all events propagate in react except onScroll

**stopping propagation**

event handlers receive an event object as their only argument.

`e` is the common name for the event object.

the event object lets you stop propagating by calling `e.stopPropagation()`

```jsx
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={e => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      onClick();
    }}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}


export default function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div className="Toolbar" onClick={() => {
      alert('You clicked on the toolbar!');
    }}>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Playing!')}>
        Play Movie
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Uploading!')}>
        Upload Image
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- react calls `onClick` handler passed to `<button>`
- handler defined in `Button` stops propagation and calls the `onClick` function psased as prop from the `Toolbar` component

**passing handlers as alternative to propagation**

```jsx
function Button({ onClick, children }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={e => {
      e.stopPropagation();
      onClick();
    }}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

`<button>` is handling propagation. it could also handle the event while letting the parent component define additional behavior.

this handles propagation in a manual mechanism to have more control when tracing handlers

**prevent default behavior**

some browser events have default behavior associated with them.

`<form>` submit event will reload the whole page 

```jsx
export default function Signup() {
  return (
    <form onSubmit={() => alert('Submitting!')}>
      <input />
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}

// call preventDefault on the event
return (
    <form onSubmit={(e) => {
      e.prevventDefault();
      alert('submitting!');
    }}>
      <input />
      <button>Send</button>
    </form>
  );
```

event handlers have side effects, the best place to have side effects actually.

event handlers don't need to be pure.

event handlers are great to change data, in order to change it we need to store it in *state*.

## state: a component's memory

components often change displayed data as a result of an interaction.

typing into a form should update the input field.

clicking next on an image carousel should change the displayed image.

clicking buy puts a product in the shopping cart.

component-specific memory is called state

adding state is done using a hook `useState`

hooks are special functions that let your components use react features.

the `useState` allows to declare a state variable

it takes initial state and return a pair of values, the current state and a state setter function to update it.

```jsx
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);
```

regular variables aren't enough

```jsx
export default function Gallery() {
  let index = 0;

  function handleClick() {
    index = index + 1;
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

`handleClick` event handler is updating a local variable

- local variables don't persist between renders.
- changes to local variables won't trigger renders. React doesn't realize it needs to render the component with new data.

to update data
- retain data between renders
- trigger react to render the component with new data

the `useState` hook provides
- a state variable to retain data
- a state setter function to update the variable to trigger react to re-render

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

// replace
let index = 0;

// with
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

array destructuring is used to read values from an array.

the array returned by `useState` always has two items

```jsx
export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

hooks are special functions only available while react is rendering. 

**pitfall**

- hooks can only be called at the top level of components or own hooks.
- can't call hook inside conditions, loops or nested functions
- you use react features at the top of the component in a similar way we import modules at the top level of a script.

**anatomy of useState**

is a convention to name the pair `[something, setSomething]`

only argument `useState` receives is the initial value of the state variable.

everytime the component renders, `useStatae` gives an array containing two values
- state variable
- state setter function

- component renders first time, `index` initial value is 0
- updating state `setIndex(index + 1)` it tells react to remember index is 1 and triggers another render
- component's second render, react still sees `useState(0)` but *remembers* that index is 1

**multiple state variables**

```jsx
export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

> hooks rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component

this is possible if you call hooks only at the top level.

internally, react holds an array of state pairs for every component. 

[hooksk in depth](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)

**state is isolated and private**

state is local to a component instance.

if you render the same component twice, each copy will have an isolated state.

```jsx
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}
```

state is not tied to a particular function call or a scope but its local to the specific place on the screen.

`Page` component doesn't know anything about `Gallery`

> unlike props, state is fully private to the component declaring it

if both galleries should sync their states, child components should be stateless and the state should be added to their closest shared parent.

## render and commit

before components are displayed they must be rendered

the process of requesting and serving UI
- triggering a render
- rendering the component
- commiting to the DOM

**1. trigger a render**

a component renders
- if it's the initial render
- the component's state has been updated (or ancestor)

when the app starts the initial render needs to be triggered.

`createRoot` is called passing the target DOM node where the app will be injected.

then call it's render method taking a component

```jsx
import Image from './Image.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Image />);

/*  ------------  */

export default function Image() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF6s192.jpg"
      alt="'Floralis Genérica' by Eduardo Catalano: a gigantic metallic flower sculpture with reflective petals"
    />
  );
}
```

the app re-renders when state updates

after the initial render, further re-renders can be triggered by updating state with a `set` function.

updating a component state queues a render.

**2. react renders components**

after triggering the render, react calls components to figure out what to display.

> rendering is react invoking (calling) the components

on initial render react calls the root.

for subsequent renders, react will call the function component whose state update triggered the render.

> process is recursive

if the updated component, returns other component, react will render that component until there are no more nested components.

`Gallery()` and `Image()` are called several times.

```jsx
// index.js
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))
root.render(<Gallery />);

// gallery.js
export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Inspiring Sculptures</h1>
      <Image />
      <Image />
      <Image />
    </section>
  );
}

function Image() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/ZF6s192.jpg"
      alt="'Floralis Genérica' by Eduardo Catalano: a gigantic metallic flower sculpture with reflective petals"
    />
  );
}
```

- initial render react creates the DOM nodes for `<section>` `<h1>` and `<img>` tags.
- during re-render, react calculates which properties have changed, it won't do anything until the commit phase.

**pitfall**

rendering must always be a pure calculation, functional programming principle

**3. react commits changes to DOM**

after rendering (calling) components, react modifies the DOM.

- initial render, React uses `appendChild()` DOM API to put all the DOM nodes on screen
- for re-renders, React will apply minimal necessary operations to make the DOM match the latest rendering output.

react only changes DOM nodes if there's a difference between renders.

```jsx
export default function Clock({ time }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{time}</h1>
      <input />
    </>
  );
}

```

during commiting changes to DOM react only updates the properties that have changed `{time}` the rest is the same.

**browser paint**

after rendering is done and react updated the DOM, the browser repaints the screen (browser rendering).

use `StrictMode` to find mistakes in components

> react doesn't touch the DOM if the rendering result is the same as the last time

## state as snapshot

state behaves like a snapshot more than regular variables that you can read and write to.

setting state doesn't change the existing variable as that would go against functional programming.

setting state triggers a re-render

**setting state triggers renders**

for an interface to react to an event, the state must be updated.

pressing `send` will `setIsSent(true)` and triggers a re-render

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hi!');
  if (isSent) {
    return <h1>Your message is on its way!</h1>
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={(e) => {
      e.preventDefault();
      setIsSent(true);
      sendMessage(message);
    }}>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}

function sendMessage(message) {
  // ...
}
```

- `onSubmit` event handler executes
- `setIsSent(true)` queues a new render
- react re-renders

**rendering takes a snapshot in time**

rendering means that react is invoking a component (function).

JSX returned from that function is like a snapshot of the UI in time.

props, event handlers and local variables were calculated usint its state at the time of the render

the returned UI is interactive, it includes logic like event handlers that define what happens in response to certain inputs.

react updates screen to match snapshot and connects the event handlers.

re-rendering a component
- react calls the function again
- function returns a new JSX snapshot
- react updates the screen to match the snapshot

state is not a regular variable that disappears after the function returns.

state lives in react itself.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
        setNumber(number + 1);
      }}>+3</button>
    </>
  )
}

```

`setNumber(number + 1)` should be called three times adding 3 yet it only increments once per click.

> setting state only changes it for the next render

because `number` in the initial render is 0, the state is set three times to update it once to 1.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        alert(number);
      }}>+5</button>
    </>
  )
}

// putting a timer on the alert
return (
    <>
      <h1>{number}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => {
        setNumber(number + 5);
        setTimeout(() => {
          alert(number);
        }, 3000);
      }}>+5</button>
    </>
  )

```

a state variable's value never changes within a render even if its event handler's code is asynchronous.

the value of state variables is fixed within a single render

making event handlers less prone to timing mistakes

form sends a message with a 5 seconds delay

- press send, sending hello
- before 5 second delay, value of `to` changes to `bob`

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [to, setTo] = useState('Alice');
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello');

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    setTimeout(() => {
      alert(`You said ${message} to ${to}`);
    }, 5000);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        To:{' '}
        <select
          value={to}
          onChange={e => setTo(e.target.value)}>
          <option value="Alice">Alice</option>
          <option value="Bob">Bob</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <textarea
        placeholder="Message"
        value={message}
        onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  );
}

```

## queueing a series of state updates

setting a state variable will queue a re-render.

sometimes multiple operations on the state value are required before queueing the next render.

**react batches state updates**

this code should increase the state variable `number` by 3, but each state rendered value is fixed.

the value of `number` inside the first render will be 0, no matter how many times `setNumber(1)` is called

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 1);
  setNumber(number + 1);
  setNumber(number + 1);
}}
>
+3
</button>
```

react waits until all code in the event handler has run before processing state updates.

this allows to update multiple state variables, from multiple components, without trigerring too many re-renders

the UI won't update until after the event handler completes.

react doesn't batch across multiple events

**updating same state variable multiple times before next render**

uncommon usecase.

pass a function that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, instead of passing the next state value.

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(n => n + 1);
  setNumber(n => n + 1);
  setNumber(n => n + 1);
}}
>
+3
</button>

```

`n => n + 1` is an **updater function**

react goes through the queue and gives the final updated state.

**updating state after replacing the next value**

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 5);
  setNumber(n => n + 1);
}}>
```

- react adds `setNumber(0 + 5)` to the queue
- react adds `n => n + 1` to the queue
- during next render, react goes through the state queue and returns the final result from `useState`

`setState(x)` works like `setState(n => x)` but `n` is never used.

**replace state after updating it**

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  setNumber(number + 5);
  setNumber(n => n + 1);
  setNumber(42);
}}>
```

- reacts adds `setNumber(0 + 5)` to the queue
- `n => n + 1` react adds to the queue
- react adds `setNumber(42)` to replace the state value to the queue.

next render, state updates to `6`, but its replaced at the end to `42`.

after event handler completes, react triggers a re-render.

during re-render react process the queue.

updater functions run during rendering.

updater function must be pure and only return the result

don't set state from inside an updater function or run other side effects.

in strict mode, react runs each updater function twice but discards the second result to find mistakes.

**naming conventions**

name the updater function argument the first letters of the state variable

```jsx
setEnabled(e => !e);
setLastName(ln => ln.reverse());
setFriendCount(fc => fc * 2);
```

more verbose is to use full state variable name or use a prefix

```jsx
setEnabled(enabled => !enabled);
setEnabled(prevEnabled => !prevEnabled);
```

## updating objects in state

state can hold any kind of value, including objects.

when updating an object, you need to make a new one (or copy) and then set state to use that copy.

primitive types are immutable, read-only. 

a re-render can be triggered to replace a value.

`setX(5);`

it changes state from `0` to `5` but 0 isn't changed, rather, the variable is holding a new value of `5`

object in state

```jsx
const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

// it is possible to mutate the object
position.x = 5;
```

> objects should always be replaced not mutated.

**treat state as read-only**

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
export default function MovingDot() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0
  });
  return (
    <div
      // problem
      /* 
      onPointerMove={e => {
        position.x = e.clientX;
        position.y = e.clientY;
      }}
      */

      // solution
      onPointerMove={e => {
        setPosition({
          x: e.clientX,
          y: e.clientY
        });
      }}

      style={{
        position: 'relative',
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
      }}>
      <div style={{
        position: 'absolute',
        backgroundColor: 'red',
        borderRadius: '50%',
        transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
        left: -10,
        top: -10,
        width: 20,
        height: 20,
      }} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

this code modifies, mutates the previous state object.

without using the state setting function, react won't realize there's an update and a re-render won't be triggered.

it's like changing the order after you already ate the meal.

**local mutation is fine**

mutating an object that was just created locally is ok

```jsx
const nextPosition = {};
nextPosition.x = e.clientX;
nextPosition.y = e.clientY;
setPosition(nextPosition);

// equivalent to
setPosition({
  x: e.clientX,
  y: e.clientY
});
```

the problem is when changing an existing object that is already in state.

if a change won't impact something that depends on it, its a local mutation.

local mutations are fine while rendering.

**copying objects with spread syntax**

often is necessary to include existing data as part of a new object.

updating one field in a form, but keeping previous values for all other fields

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [person, setPerson] = useState({
    firstName: 'Barbara',
    lastName: 'Hepworth',
    email: 'bhepworth@sculpture.com'
  });

  /* 
  problem
  onChange handlers mutate the state
  */

  /*
  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    person.firstName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    person.lastName = e.target.value;
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e) {
    person.email = e.target.value;
  }
  */

  // solution
  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      firstName: e.target.value,
      lastName: person.lastName,
      email: person.email
    });
  }
  // object spread syntax solution
  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person, // copies old fields
      firstName: e.target.value // replaces this property
    });
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      lastName: e.target.value
    });
  }

  function handleEmailChange(e) {
    setPerson({
      ...person,
      email: e.target.value
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input
          value={person.firstName}
          onChange={handleFirstNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input
          value={person.lastName}
          onChange={handleLastNameChange}
        />
      </label>
      <label>
        Email:
        <input
          value={person.email}
          onChange={handleEmailChange}
        />
      </label>
      <p>
        {person.firstName}{' '}
        {person.lastName}{' '}
        ({person.email})
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

spread syntax is shallow, it only copies one level deep values

updating nested properties will need to use spread syntax more than once.

**using single event handler for multiple fields**

square brackets inside object definition can specify a property with a dynamic name using computed properties.

```jsx
function handleChange(e) {
  setPerson({
    ...person,
    [e.target.name]: e.target.value
  });
}
```

**updating a nested object**

nested object

```jsx
const [person, setPerson] = useState({
  name: 'Niki de Saint Phalle',
  artwork: {
    title: 'Blue Nana',
    city: 'Hamburg',
    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/Sd1AgUOm.jpg',
  }
});

// updating person.artwork.city is easy with mutations
person.artwork.city = 'New Delhi';

// first generate a new artwork object with data from previous one
// then produce new person object which points at the new artwork

const nextArtwork = { ...person.artwork, city: 'New Delhi' };
const nextPerson = { ...person, artwork: nextArtwork };
setPerson(nextPerson);

// or a single function call
setPerson({
  ...person, // Copy other fields
  artwork: { // but replace the artwork
    ...person.artwork, // with the same one
    city: 'New Delhi' // but in New Delhi!
  }
});

```

**immer**

if state is deeply nested is best practice to flatten it.

if state structure should be untouched, immer is a library shortcut to nested spreads.

immer uses mutating syntax but takes care of producing the copies for you

```jsx
updatePerson(draft => {
  draft.artwork.city = 'Lagos';
});
```

try immer
- add `use-immer` to `package.json` as dependency
- `npm install`
- replace `useState` import with `import { useImmer } from 'use-immer';`

**why is mutating state not recommended**

- debugging won't get clobbered by the most recent state changes.
- optimizations, if you never mutate its fast to check if there were any changes.
- new features of react rely on state being treated like a snapshot





## updating arrays in state

arrays are also mutable in javascript.

best practice is to create a new array, copy contents of existing state array and set state to the new array

updating an array should be done by passing a new array created by calling non-mutating methods like 
- filter
- map

avoid mutating methods
- push, unshift (adding)
- pop, shift, splice (removing)
- splice, `arr[i] =` (replacing)
- reverse, sort (sorting)

`slice` copies an array or part of it
`splice` mutates the array inserting or deleting items

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

let nextId = 0;

export default function List() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [artists, setArtists] = useState([]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Inspiring sculptors:</h1>
      <input
        value={name}
        onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => {
        setName('');
        // problem
        // push is mutating the artists state array
        artists.push({
          id: nextId++,
          name: name,
        });
      }}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {artists.map(artist => (
          <li key={artist.id}>{artist.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

instead create a new array containing the existing items AND new item at the end.

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  setName('');
  setArtists([
    ...artists, // put old items at the start
    { id: nextId++, name: name }
  ]);
}}
>
Add
</button>

// prepend item by placing it before original ...artists
setArtists([
  { id: nextId++, name: name },
  ...artists // Put old items at the end
]);
```

the spread operator can be used to both `push` (add at end) and `unshift` (add to beginning) elements without mutating the source state.

**removing from array**

`filter` is best practice

```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
  setArtists(
    artists.filter(a =>
      a.id !== artist.id
    )
  );
}}
>
Delete
</button>
```

**transforming an array**

changing some or all elements of an array is done using `map`/

example
- array holds coordinates of two circles and square
- pressing a button moves the circles down by 50 px
- produces a new array of data using `map`

```jsx
function handleClick() {
  const nextShapes = shapes.map(shape => {
    if (shape.type === 'square') {
      // No change
      return shape;
    } else {
      // Return a new circle 50px below
      return {
        ...shape,
        y: shape.y + 50,
      };
    }
  });
    // Re-render with the new array
  setShapes(nextShapes);
}
```

**replacing items in an array**

`arr[0] = bird` mutates the original array, so `map` can be used instead.

to replace item, create new array with `map`, use element index to decide whether to return the original item or something else

```jsx
function handleIncrementClick(index) {
    const nextCounters = counters.map((c, i) => {
      if (i === index) {
        // Increment the clicked counter
        return c + 1;
      } else {
        // The rest haven't changed
        return c;
      }
    });
    setCounters(nextCounters);
  }

return (
    <ul>
      {counters.map((counter, i) => (
        <li key={i}>
          {counter}
          <button onClick={() => {
            handleIncrementClick(i);
          }}>+1</button>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
```

**inserting into an array**

insert an item at a particular position.

`...` array spread syntax with `slice` method achieves this.

`slice` lets you cut the array, then to insert an item, an array spreads the slice before the insertion point, then the new item, and the rest of the original array.

```jsx
function handleClick() {
  const insertAt = 1; // Could be any index
  const nextArtists = [
    // Items before the insertion point:
    ...artists.slice(0, insertAt),
    // New item:
    { id: nextId++, name: name },
    // Items after the insertion point:
    ...artists.slice(insertAt)
  ];
  setArtists(nextArtists);
  setName('');
}
```

**making other changes**

some things can't be done with spread syntax or non-mutating methods.

reversing and sorting mutate the original source.

copying the array and then making changes to it is allowed

```jsx
function handleClick() {
  const nextList = [...list];
  nextList.reverse();
  setList(nextList);
}
```

assigning operations which are mutating are still not possible as the copy is shallow, the new array will contains the same reference to the elements of the source array thus modifying one modifies both.

```jsx
const nextList = [...list];
nextList[0].seen = true; // Problem: mutates list[0]
setList(nextList);
```

**updating objects inside arrays**

each object is not *really* located *inside* an array.

each object in an array is a value stored in a separate place in memory (heap).

the array points (has a reference) to that object in memory.

shallow copies, don't create new objects, just copy references.

when updating state, we need to create copies from the point where we want to update, and all the way up to the top level.

```jsx
function handleToggleMyList(artworkId, nextSeen) {
    // problem
    // shallow copy only copies by reference
    const myNextList = [...myList];
    const artwork = myNextList.find(
      a => a.id === artworkId
    );
    artwork.seen = nextSeen;
    setMyList(myNextList);
  }
```
`myNextList` is a new array, but the items are the same as in the original `myList`

changing `artwork.seen` changes the original artwork item as well.

using map to substitute old item with updated version without mutation

```jsx

setMyList(myList.map(artwork => {
  if (artwork.id === artworkId) {
    // Create a *new* object with changes
    return { ...artwork, seen: nextSeen };
  } else {
    // No changes
    return artwork;
  }
}));
```

just as with objects, **immer** allows to use mutating syntax and under the hood produces a nested copy

if the state object is very deep, it should be restructure to flatten it

immer mutates a `draft` object and then constructs the next state from stratch according to the changes made to `draft`.
