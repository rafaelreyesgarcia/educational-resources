# **QUICK START**

## **create and nest components**

a component is a piece of UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance

react components are javascript functions that return markup

```jsx
function MyButton() {
  return <button>I'm a button</button>
}
```
after declaring MyButton, you can nest it into another component

```js
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton/>
    </div>
  )
}
```
components start with a capital letter, HTML tags start with a lower case

export default keywords specify the main component in the file

**JSX syntax**

stricter than HTML
- empty tags must be closed
`<br/>`
- component can't return multiple JSX tags, they have to wrap into a shared parent `<div>` or an empty wrapper (fragment) `<></>`
    
## **add style to components**

className works the same way as HTML class attribute

`<img className="avatar">`

then a separate CSS file to write the rules
```css
    .avatar {
      border-radius: 50%;
    }
```

## **displaying data**

curly braces can escape back into javascript to embed a variable to display value to user

```jsx
return (
  <h1>
    {user.name}
  </h1>
);
```

escape into javascript from JSX attributes curly braces are used instead of quotes

```jsx
return (
  <img
    className="avatar"
    src={user.imageUrl}
  />
);
```

## **conditional rendering**

same techniques with regular javascript

ternary operator works inside JSX

when the else branch is not needed, shorter logicall && syntax can be used
  
## **rendering lists**

relies on for loops array .map() function to render list of components

`<li>` will have a key attribute

map will transform the contents of an array, objects, and will pass a string or number found in the key id usually coming from a database

## **responding to events**

respond to events by declaring event handler functions inside components

you don't need to call the event handler function, it only needs to be passed down

react will call the event handler when the user clicks the button
  
## **updating the screen**

you need to add state to a component to remember information and display it

```js
import {useState} from 'react';
```

useState adds
- `count`
current state
- `setCount`
function that lets you update current state
      
can be named anything but best practice is something, setSomething
    
> rendering a stateful component multiple times will set a custom state to each

## **using hooks**

functions with a prefixed name use--- are called hooks

`useState` is a built-in hook provided by react

you can also write custom hooks by combining existing ones

hooks are more restrictive than regular functions

can only call hooks at the top level of a component or other hooks.
  
## **sharing data between components (lifting state up)**

often is needed to share data and update components together

we need to move state from child components upwards to the closest parent component

updating a parent component should update child components

parent component contains state and event handler declaration

passes both of them down as props to each children component

update the children function to pass the props from the parent component


## **building a searchable product data table (thinking in react)**

JSON API and a mockup from a designer

API fetches an array of objects (products)

the mockup wants to display a table with the products, mark the ones out of stock and provide a filter so the user can filter them if needed

**1. break UI into component hierarchy**

- programming  
single responsability principle  
a component should ideally only do one thing  
- CSS  
how to split components based on the selectors you'll use  
- design  
considering how to organize the design layers
      
if JSON is well structured, it will naturally map to the component structure of the UI

UI and data models often have the same information architecture

**breaking the UI of a filterable product table**

- **filterableProductTable**
contains the whole app
- **SearchBar**
receives user input
- **ProductTable**
displays and filters the list according to the user input
- **ProductCategoryRow**
displays heading for each category
- **ProductRow**
displays a row for each product
        
**2. build static version in react**

build a static version by building components that reuse other components and pass data as props

props is an object used to pass data from parent to child

**one-way data flow**
data flows from top-level component to the ones at the bottom of the tree

**3. state**
changes the underlying data model making the UI component interactive

DRY principle is important for structuring state

think if the pieces of data are state

does it remain unchanged overtime? **no**  
passed in from parent via props? **no**  
compute data based on existing state or props in a component? **yes!**  

**props vs state**

props
- are arguments you pass to a function
- let a parent component pass data to a child component 

state 
- is like a component's memory
-  lets the component keep track of some information and change it in response to interactions
    
**4. identify where state should live**

after identifying minimal state data

react uses one-way data flow 

it may not be immediately clear which component should own what state

often state can be put directly into a common parent component

state can also be put into a component above the common parent

you can create a component solely to hold the state of multiple children components

identify components that use state

find common parent

decide where the state lives

add state to the component with useState() hook

Hooks allow to hook into a component's render cycle

**5. add inverse data flow**
