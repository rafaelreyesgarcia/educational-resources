# **INSTALLATION**

start a new react project
    
react is a library to organize UI code by separating it into components.

react doesn't take care of routing or data management

builds a single-page, client-side application.

different ways to start a react project

## **1. HTML file and script tag**

## **2. Minimal Toolchain**

install node.js and NPM 

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

this approach doesn't handle backend logic or databases

it can be used with any backend

initializes folder with static HTML, CSS, JS

> create-react-app can't handle the server, doesn't provide best performance

minimal toolchain alternatives
- Vite
- Parcel

## **3. opinionated framework** 
      
start with opinionated framework that has common features (data fetching, routing)

great for faster loading times and built-in features (routing, server-side logic)

**full-featured framework**

- **next.js**  
lightweight for static and server-rendered applications built with react.  
prepackaged with features like routing, styling and server-side rendering .
        
**alternatives**
- gatsby
- remix
- razzle
        
## **4. custom toolchains**

components of a toolchain

**package manager** 
installs updates and manages third-party packates

- npm
- yarn
- pnpm

**compiler (transpiler?)**
compiles modern language features, syntax like JSX or type annotations for browsers

- babel
- typescript
- swc

**bundler**
lets you bundle multiple files (modular code) into small packages to optimizie load time

- webpack
- parcel
- esbuild
- swc
          
**minifier**
makes code more compact so it loads faster
            
- terser
- swc

**server**
handles server requests so that you can render components to HTML

- express.js

**linter**
checks code for common mistakes

**test runner**
run tests against code

- jest

manage multiple packages in a single repository
- nx
- turborepo
  
## **add react to a website**

**1. add root HTML tag**

\<div> element to render react components

needs id attribute set
    
is where the react tree starts

placed inside anywhere the \<body>

is left empty so react renders the components dynamically

multiple root components are allowed on one page

**2. add script tags**

before the closing body \<script>

`react.development.js` lets you define react components

`react.production.min.js` when deploying to a live website

`react-dom.development.js` lets react render HTML elements to the DOM
react-dom-production.min.js

`component.js` where the react component will be created

**3. minify javascript for production**

unminified code can slow down page load times for users

before deploying, its best practice to minify the scripts

reason why deploying HTML documents that loads React.production.min.js and react-dom.production.min.js are performant and fast
      
**setting up a minifier**
```sh
        npm init -y
        npm install terser

npx terser -c -m -o like-button.min.js -- like-button.js
# produces minified code in the same directory
```

**JSX syntax**

javascript
```js
return React.createElement('button', {onClick: () => setLiked(true)}, 'like');
```
JSX
```jsx
return <button onClick={() => setLiked(true)}>Like</button>;
```
    
**4. add JSX to a project**

install a jsx preprocessor: babel

```sh
npm init -y 

# this initializes node package manager(npm) to keep track of all dependencies for the project

npm install babel-cli@6 babel-preset-react-app@3

# babel client installation, JSX preprocessor and react babel preset
```
**5. run the JSX preprocessor**

every time a file is saved, the transform will convert jsx into js

create folder called src

```sh
npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod
# starts an automated watched for edits to JSX in src, the watcher creates a preprocessed js file with plain js
```

babel is a JSX preprocessor (compiler) and also creates polyfills for modern javascript syntax for older browsers
  
**react without JSX**

- using `htm`  
uses javascript template strings instead of a compiler

- use `React.createElement()` 
has a special structure

```jsx
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(React.createElement(component, props, ...children));
```
***component*** 
can be a string representing HTL element or a function component
      
***object***
of any props you want to pass

***children***
children components (text strings or other elements)
      
a shorthand can be assigned for `React.createElement` 

```js
const e = React.createElement;
root.render(e('div', null, 'hello world'));
```

## **editor setup**

**vscode**

alternatives
- webstorm
- sublime text
- vim
    
**linting**

ESlint config for react

ESLint extension for vs code
    
**prettier**

cleans up code reformatting it to conform to preset configurable rules

tab conversion to spaces, indentation, quotes

vscode extesion

formatting on save

- CTRL + SHIFT + P
- settings
- format on save option ticked

## **react developer tools**

- inspect react components
- edit props and state
- identify performance problems
      
**browser extension**

for safari, other browsers and react native

```sh
# install react-devtools npm package
npm install -g react-devtools

# open developer tools from terminal
react-devtools
```

add tag to the beginning of the website's head

`<script src="http://localhost:8097"></script>`
