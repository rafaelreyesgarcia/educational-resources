# **javascript fundamentals**

## <center>**HELLO WORLD**</center>

**<dt>script tags</dt>** 

<dd>inserted in HTML</dd><br>

**HTML4 standard required the following attributes (aren't required anymore)**

- `type="text/javascript"`<br>
  now used for modules type="module"

- `language="en"` <br>
  meant to define the language of the script

**external scripts**  
`src="/path/to/file.js"`  

browsers download external files and store them in cache. 

Other pages can reference the same script from the cacheinstead of downloading it every time.  
      
referencing an external file, disables reading the contentof the script tag

## <center>**CODE STRUCTURE**</center>

**<dt>statements</dt>**
<dd>syntax constructs and commands that perform actions separated by semicolon. </dd><br>

**<dt>automatic semicolon insertion</dt>**
<dd>semicolons in statements can be omitted when a line break exists. In most cases it will be inserted not always.</dd>  <br>
 
when lines end with an operator, js implies that it's an incomplete expression.
    
**comments** 
      
    /* multiline */
    // one-line

`ctrl + /` common shortcut for comments in an IDE.  
encourages better communication through code.  
minifiers can remove comments to reduce file size.

## **<center>THE MODERN MODE "USE STRICT"</center>**    

`"use strict"`  

- enables features introduced in ES5 that are off by default.  
can also be used in just local scope, required to be placed at the top of the scope.

- classes and modules enable use strict automatically.

## **<center>VARIABLES</center>**
named storage for data  
store values  
`let` `const` and `var` keywords create (declare) variables  

***values*** are assigned to ***variables***  
the value is saved into ***memory*** associated with the variable (binding).  

multiple variable declarations is done by separating them with a comma ,

var is the older keyword to declare variables in js let and const were introduced in **ES6**.

variables can be ***reassigned*** different values

### **copying variables**

    let variable1 = "string";  
    let variable2;  
    variable1 = variable2;  
    
declaring a variable twice throws a **SyntaxError**.  

**referencing** a variable is done without the declaration keyword.

in **functional programming** (scala, erlang), the language forbid changing variable values.
  
to store something, you always need to declare a new variable.

### **variable naming** 
names must contain only  
- letters
- digits
- symbol $ _
- first character must not be a digit
    
camelCase is used for names with more than one word.

names are case-sensitive.

non-latin letters are allowed but not recommended.

reserved words can't be used as names.

variable name should be obvious, clean, and descriptive.

it was technically possible to assign a value to a variable without using a declaration keyword.

- not possible in 'use strict'
- bad practice for modern development
        
### **constants**  
declared using the const keyword  
they can't be reassigned  
almost equivalent to functional programming

uppercase constants 

- naming variables with complex values that are known prior execution

- named with uppercase and underscores between words

- const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
            
## **<center>DATA (VALUE) TYPES</center>**

a value always is of a certain type

8 types in javascript.  
- 7 primitive  
- 1 special  

### **Primitive types**
---

**NUMBER** 
<dd>

represents integer and floating point numbers    
there are numeric operators

***special numeric values***

**Infinity**   
represents mathematical infinity  
greater than any number  
result of a division by zero

**- Infinity**  
negative infinity  
        
**NaN**  
represents a computational error  
result of incorrect or undefined mathematical operation   
it propagates so any operation done with NaN will return NaN
</dd>

**BIGINT**

<dd>
the number type can't represent integer values  larger than `2**53-1 | -(2**53-1)`.  

not all digits fit into the fixed **64-bit storage**, so this produces a **precision error** on numbers outisde that `+-(2**53-1)` range  

large integers outside that range, can go up to `1.7976931348623157 * 10**308`

a BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer.
</dd>  

**STRING**

<dd>

must be delimited by quotes, double quotes or backticks `"" | '' | `` `

**backticks** ` `` `   
are delimiters with extended functionality  
backticks create template literals `${} `   
a string can be empty (zero characters), one character or multiple 
</dd>

**BOOLEAN**

<dd>

can only be `true` and `false`
can be the result of a comparison operation
</dd>

**NULL**

<dd>

it represents nothing, empty or value unknown. 
used to unset variables.
</dd>

**UNDEFINED**

<dd>

value not assigned.

a variable that is declared but not assigned.

can be explicitly assigned to a variable.

can unset variables too but is recommended to be used only as a default initial value for unassigned variables.
</dd>
        
**SYMBOL**

create unique identifiers for objects

### **special types**
---
**Object**

<dd>

used to store collections of data and complex entities  
functions arrays, etc belong to the object type
</dd>

**typeof operator**

returns the type of the argument  

result of typeof null is object  
typeof object; (returns null)  
actual bug in the js language  
        
object, array and function should all return object  
function returns function
        
syntax can be typeof x but also typeof(x)


## **<center>INTERACTION (ALERT, PROMPT, CONFIRM)</center>**

methods of the window object, only existing in the browser  

modal windows pause execution of scripts, until the modal window has been dismissed
    
**alert**

opens a modal window (can't interact with the rest of the page until the modal window has been dealt with by pressing ok)

**prompt**  
accepts two arguments
- `title`  
text to show the visitor
- `[default]`  
initial value of the input field  
*square brackets here means its an optional character* 

calling prompt returns the user input in the modal window the method opens when the user press enter

returns null if the input was canceled by pressing cancel or the ESC key

always supply [default] parameter as IE requires it otherwise it inserts undefined into the prompt

**confirm**  
opens a modal window with a question and two buttons  
- `ok` returns true 
- `cancel` returns false

## **<center>TYPE CONVERSIONS</center>**

most functions use type conversion to convert the values to the right type to perform operations.

can be implicit or explicit conversions.

explicit is needed when the value is coming from a string-based source, but the value needs to be used as a number.

**string conversion**  
`String(value)`
    
**numeric conversion**  
`Number(value)`
    
*numeric conversion rules*

- undefined becomes NaN
- null becomes 0
- true and false become 1 and 0
- white spaces of a string are removed
- if the string is empty the result is 0
- if the string is not a valid number, (conversion error) returns NaN
    
**boolean conversion**  
can be perfomed explicitly by calling `Boolean(value)`  
can appear in logical operations
    
values that are 'empty' become false
- 0
- "" (empty string)
- null
- undefined
- NaN
    
other values become true
- "0" is true because the string is not empty

## **<center>BASIC OPERATORS, MATHS</center>**

**operand**

what operators are applied to  
the expressions we want to use in the operation  
operands are also sometimes called arguments 

**operators**  
performs an operation on a single or multiple operands

**unary**  
applied to a single operand
        
**binary**  
the operation is carried between two operands
        
**ternary**  
3 operands
        
**arithmetic operators**  

addition +  
substraction -  
multiplication *  
division /  

*remainder %*   
result of a % b is the remainder of dividing a by b 

exponentiation **  
a ** b raises a to the power of b    
also applies to non-integer numbers (fractions) 4 ** (1/2)  
same as square root 8 ** (1/3)  
same as cubic root  
        
  string concatenation with binary +
    addition operator is meant to be used on numbers
    but if it is applied to strings, it merges them (concatenates)
    
    let concat = "my" + "string"
    console.log(concat)
      mystring
        
    in a binary operation, if one operand is a string, the other one will be coerced into a string

      2 + 2 + '1' = 41
        numbers will be evaluated as numbers, until their sum meets a string, then it concatenates
      
      '1' + 2 + 2 = 122
        string will propagate all operation results into a string
        
  unary+
    binary form of + is to add or concatenate
    unary doesn't change anything to number types but if the operand is not a number, it will coerce it into a number
    does the same thing as Number()
    
    +true
      1
    +false
      0
    +""
      0
        
  operator precedence
    default priority order of operators
    execution order is from left to right

    precedence table
      unary+
      unary-
      exponentiation
      multiplication
      division
      addition
      substraction
      assignment 
        modify-assign operators += -= *= /=
            
    
  assignment returns a value 
    assignment operator executes storing a value in a variable and then returning it

    chaining assignments
      a = b = c = d = 2 + 2
        all will be assigned 4

  modify-assign
    operators that operate with the previous and next value of a variable and store the result 
    
    += -= *= /=
    have the same precedence of the assignment operator

  increment/decrement
    
    ++ increases a variable by 1
    -- decreases a variable by 1

    throws syntax error when used on numerical values
    
    can be placed before or after a variable
      before (prefix)
        ++counter
        returns new value
        increase a value to use it immediately 
      after (postfix)
        counter---
        returns the old value prior to increment/decrement
        increase a value but returns the previous value
        
    precedence is higher than other arithmetical operators
    
  bitwise operators

    treat arguments (operands) as 32-bit integer numbers

      AND &
      OR | 
      XOR ^
      NOT ~
      LEFT SHIFT <<
      RIGHT SHIFT >>
      ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT >>>

  comma operator ,
0
    allows to evaluate several expressions
    each expression is evaluated but only the last is returned

COMPARISONS

  greater than > 
  less than <
  greater than or equal >=
  less than or equal <=
  abstract equality ==
  strict equality ===
  != not equal
  !== strictly not equal

  comparisons return a boolean value 

  string comparison
    js uses lexicographical order
      compares the first character of both strings
      
      if the first character of one string is greater than the other, its determined and that's done, otherwise, each character is compared until a greater character is found
      
      if both strings end at the same length they are equal

      greater or less than a character is defined by the index of the internal encoding table (unicode)
        
  comparison of different types
    when comparing values of different types js prefers to converts values to numbers

    '2' > 1 
      string 2 becomes number 2
    '01' == 1 
      01 string becomes number 1
        
    0 is false
      string '0' is true as its not an empty string
      
      when 0 and '0' are compared, it returns true as the string '0' becomes number 0

  strict equality
    when comparing values of different types, 
    === checks equality without type conversion
    
    immediately returns false if types are different
    
  comparison with null and undefined
    null === undefined
      false as they are different types
    null == undefined
      true
        
    comparisons (> < >= <=) convert null to a number, treating null as 0

    equality check without any conversions (strict) both null and undefined equal to themselves and nothing else

  comparing undefined with anything else
    in comparisons undefined is converted to NaN
    
    NaN returns false for all comparisons
    
    in equality checks undefined only equals to null and undefined

CONDITIONAL BRANCHING

  if statement
    evaluates a condition in parentheses and if result is true, executes a block of code

    condition
      simple equality check

    evaluates expression and converts the result to a boolean

    also can pass a pre-evaluated boolean stored in a variable

    falsy values
      0
      ""
      null
      undefined
      NaN
        
  else statement
    executes a block of code when the condition in the if statement returns false
    
  else if
    several variants of a condition
    
  conditional operator ?
    shorthand for an if else statement
    ternary operator
    
    let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
    value1 is returned for a condition that evaluated to true
    value2 is returned for a condition that evaluated to false

    chaining conditional operators

      if ? then : else (if) ? then : else(if) ? then : else
        
    sometimes ? ternary operator can be used to replace if keyword

LOGICAL OPERATORS

  OR ||
  AND &&
  NOT !
  Nullish coalescing ??

  can be applied to values of any type not only boolean
  result can be of any type

  OR ||
    if any argument returns true, it returns true,
    otherwise false

    boolean values
    true || true
      true
    false || true
      true
    true || false
      true
    false || false
      false
        
    if an operand is not a boolean, the value is converted into a boolean
      1 is true
      0 is false
        
    OR finds the first truthy value
    evaluates operands from left to right
    each operand is converted to boolean
    the first one that turns true, returns the original value before boolean conversion
    if all were false, it returns the last operand value
        
    shortcircuit evaluation
      if a value is true, it will return that value and stop without touching a second argument

      useful when an operand isn't just a value but an expression with a side effect like a variable assignment or function call

  AND &&
    returns true if both operands are truthy and false otherwise

    boolean values
      true && true
        true 
      true && false
        false 
      false && true
        false
      false && false 
        false
        
    given multiple arguments
      evaluates from left to right
      each operand is converted to boolean

      if result is false, it returns original value of that operand

      if all were truthy it returns the last operand
      
      precedence of && is higher than ||

      sometimes people replace if with &&
          not good practice
        
  !NOT
    result = !value;
    accepts a single argument
    converts operand to boolean
    returns the inverse value

    a double not !! can be used to convert a value to boolean
        does the same as Boolean()

NULLISH COALESCING OPERATOR

  two question marks ??
  a ?? b 
  defined, set assigned (interchangble terms)
  if a is defined, then return a
  if a isn't defined, then b

  simpler way to write
      (a !== null && a !== undefined) ? a : b;
  
  chaining ??
      first ?? second ?? third ?? fourth

  || returns the first truthy value
  ?? returns the first defined value

  || doesn't distinguish between false 0 "" and null/undefined

  ?? will behave as if false is only null or undefined(empty)

  precedence is the same as ||

  javascript doesn't allow to use ?? with && ||
    unless the precedence is explicitly defined with parentheses
    
LOOPS
  repeat code multiple times

  iteration
    single loop execution

  while
    while(condition) {block of code}
  
    any expression or variable can be a loop condition
    
    while converts the condition to a boolean

    curly braces aren't needed for a single line body

    do...while

      do {
        block of code/loop body
      } while (condition);
    
      loop will execute once no matter the condition, then the condition is evaluated, converted to boolean and the loop will iterate again while truthy


  for
    for (begin; condition; step){
      block of code/ loop body
    };

    begin
      executes upon entering the loop
    condition
      checked before every iteration,
      loop stops when false
    body 
      runs while the condition is truthy
    step
      executes after the body on each iteration
    
    inline variable declaration
      counters are declared in the loop
      we can also just declare the variable first and assign it in the loop
        
    any part of for can be skipped

      for (; 1 <3; i++) begin is omitted
      for (; i <3;) ommits steps as well
      for (;;) infinite loop
        syntax error if not using proper semicolons
        
    breaking a loop
      loops exit when condition returns falsy
      forcing the exit is done with the break directive
      a break directive should be inside the body of a loop

    continue to next iteration
      continue keyword is a softer break
      stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one

      helps decrease nesting 

      labels for break/continue
        in nested loops, it can determine where to break and continue from, outer or inner loop
        
        labelName: for loop
    
    syntax constructs that aren't expressions can't be used with the ternary operator
        
THE SWITCH STATEMENT
  can replace multiple if checks

  switch(x) {
    case value1:
      block of code
      break

    case value2:
      block of code
      break

    default:
      block of code
      break
  }

  value of the argument passed to the switch statement is checked using strict equality to the value from the cases

  if the equality check matches x with a value, that code block executes, otherwise, if no cases match with x, default block executes and breaks out of the switch statement

  without a break directive, the switch statement will continue executing blocks after finding a match
  

  grouping cases to run the same program is possible
    case value1:
    case value2:
      code block
      break;

    this is a side effect of not using a break statement between value1 and value2
        

  both switch and case arguments allow arbitrary expressions (expresions that wil evaluate to a result)

  the equality check in a switch statement is always strict

FUNCTIONS
  building blocks of a program
  allow programs to be called many times

  regular values represent data

  functions represent actions to take, a blueprint of instructions to perform

  function declaration
    
    function name() {
      block of code;
    }
    
  parameters
    arguments passed to the function in the parentheses
    arbitrary values
    used in function declaration

    usually the given values will be stored in local variables for the function to perform operations on them
    
  argument
    value that is passed to the function when its called
    
  invokation
    done by calling the name of the function
      functionName();
    
  local variables
    each function has a local scope where variables are only visible inside the function

  shadowing
    re-declaring a variable is possible inside a function, that shadows the outer variable, ignoring it
    
  outer (global) variables
    function can access an outer variable,
    functions can modify a global variable too
    
  default values
    if an argument is not provided in a function call,
    the value becomes undefined

    parameter = 'default value if not given'

    a function returns NaN

    a function can be called as a default parameter to a parent function

    alternative default values
      if (parameter === undefined) {
        parameter = 'default value';
      }

      parameter = parameter || 'no text given';

      (parameter ?? 'unknown')
        
  returning a value
    the return directive will stop the function once the execution reaches it

    the value is returned to the program that called the function

    recurrences of return in a single function ca nhappen in if else statements
      one return after the if
      one return after the else
        
    when a function doesn't return a value or has an empty return, it returns undefined

    never add new lines between the return directive and the value to be returned

    if return expression has to be wrapped in multiple lines, parentheses should be used

  naming a function
    functions are actions
    names should be verbs

    prefixes can be used as guides
      get 
        return a value
      calc
        calculate an operation
      create
        create anything
      check
        return a boolean after evaluating something
        
      a function should ideally do one thing and one thing only

  if a function is too big
    best practice is to split it in multiple small functions

FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS
  function declaration syntax
    function name() {code block};

    declared as a separate statement with all the logic of the function

    a function declaration can be called earlier than it is defined

    when javascript parses the source code, it initializes variables and functions found in scopes

    after scopes and initialization, then the code is ready for execution

    a call is read on execution, a declaration is initialized while parsing (compiling)
        
    in strict mode, function declaration within a code block, is visible everywhere inside that block but not outside
      solution to this is declare a variable in global scope and leave it empty, and in local scope, assign the function expression
        
    function declaration is usually recommended for better readability
        
  function expression syntax
    let name = function() {code block};

    declares a variable and assigns it a function as value

    the name of the function to call will be the variable name

    should include semicolon at the end as its an expression after an assignment operator, the syntax is not for functions but for expressions

    a function is an expression when declared as an expression, inside another syntax construct
      inside the assignment expression is common
      inside the parentheses of a method

    a function expression is created when execution reaches it and is usable until then

    function expressions are ideal for contidional declarations
    
  a function is a value
    the function declaration can be copied when the    function is used as a value and not invoked with parentheses

    a function can be stored as a variable when not invoked, if invoked, the variable will store the return value of the function
    
  callback functions
    we pass a function and expect it to be called back later if necessary

    functions declared inside the argument of a call, have no name, thus anonymous

    anonymous functions are not accessible outside of the syntax construct they are passed on

  

ARROW FUNCTIONS 
  introduced in ES6
  better than function expressions

  let func = (parameters) => expression;
    creates a function that evaluates the expression using the arguments passed in parentheses, to return a result
    
  if there are no arguments needed, parentheses are still needed to be included empty

  can be used the same way as function expressions

  multiline arrow functions
    curly braces are needed if the expression is multiline

    curly braces require a return (parentheses needed for multiline return statements)

SPECIALS (recap)
