# Classes

## **CLASS BASIC SYNTAX**

a class is an extensible template for creating objects

provides initial values for state
and implementations of behavior

```JS
class MyClass {
  constructor(){}
  method1(){}
  method2(){}
  methodN(){}
}
```

`new MyClass()` creates an object with all listed methods

constructor() is called automatically by new and initializes the object

no commas are needed to separate class methods, would throw a `SyntaxError`

a class is a function, the constructor method

methods are stored in `obj.prototype`

`Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj.prototype);`
returns constructor and methods defined 
    
### **class vs pure function**

sometimes class syntax is considered syntactic sugar (syntax that improves readability but nothing else)
    
a function created by class, is labeled by internal property [[IsClassConstructor]]: true

a class can only be called with the new constructor

string representations of the class constructor in most engines starts with the word class

class methdos are non-enumerable

class definition sets enumerable:false for all methods in the prototype

for..in loops usually don't want class methods so its good that they are non-enumerable

classes always use 'use strict'

all code inside the class construct is in strict mode automatically
        
### **class expression**

classes can be defined inside another expression by
- being passed 
- returned
- assigned
        
just like function expressions

### **getters/setters for classes**

just like literal objects, classes can have getters/setters, computed properties

### **class fields**

class fields is syntax that allows to add any properties

propertyName = value;

difference is that they are set on individual objects, not Class.prototype

complex expressions can be assigned as values
    
### **bound calls with class fields**

javascript has a dynamic this, it depends on the context of the call

if an object method is passed and called in another context, this won't be referencing the object anymore

losing `this` can be fixed by
- passing a wrapper `(() => ), 1000)`
- binding the method to object in the constructor
        
the class field is created on a per-object basis

a separate function for each object created with the class

this will always reference that object 

### **class syntax**

```js
class MyClass {
  prop = value;

  constructor() {}

  method(){}
  get somethind() {}
  set something() {}

  [Symbol.iterator]() {}
}
```

## **CLASS INHERITANCE**

one class can inherit another class 

creates new functionality on top of existing

### **extends keyword**

class Child extends Parent

a child class that inherits from parent 

the extends keyword works using the old prototype mechanics
sets Child.prototype.[[Prototype]] to Parent.prototype

any expression is allowed after extends, a function call that generates the parent class
        
### **overwritting methods**

methods not defined in the child, 
are taken directly as is from the parent class
overwritting an inherited method is as easy as just defining it in the child class

### **super keyword**

to not overwrite a method, but instead build on top of a parent method, the `super` keyword is used

`super.method()`
calls a parent method

`super()` 
calls a parent constructor 
        
arrow functions do not have super, if accessed, it calls the outer function.
    
### **overwritting constructors**

when a class extends another without having its own constructor, then an empty default constructor is generated

```js
constructor(...args) {
  super(...args);
}
```

constructors in inheriting classes must call super before using this

a derived constructor (from inheriting class) has an internal property

[[ConstructorKind]]:derived

that label affects the behavior with new

function executes with new, creates empty object assigning it to this

derived constructor executes, expects the parent constructor to execute

the object for this won't be created if we don't call super in the derived constructor

### **overriding class **

parent constructor always uses the field value, inherited class even if overriding a field, won't be used

only after the inherited class calls super, the parent constructor executes, then the class fields are initialized.

> difference between fields and methods is unique to javascript
    
### **super: internals [[HomeObject]]**

when a function is defined as a class or object method, then [[HomeObject]] property becomes that object or class

the only place in the language where [[HomeObject]] is used is super

## **STATIC PROPERTIES AND METHODS**

### **static keyword**

assigns a method to the class

`static methodName(){}`

is the same as

`Class.property = function(){}`
    
static methods are used to implement functions that belong to the class, not to a specific method

not available for individual objects

static properties are a recent addition to the language

inheritance of static properties and methods

## **PRIVATE AND PROTECTED PROPERTIES AND METHODS**

delimiting internal interface from external interface is core to object oriented programming

the secret of reliability simplicity and easy to use = encapsulation

### **internal interface**

methods and properties accessible from other methods of the class but not outside
    
### **external interface**

methods and properties, accessible also from outside the class
    
### **public**
accessible from anywhere, external interface

### **private**
accessible only inside the class, internal interface
    
protected fields are not implemented in the language but can be emulated

protected (private) properties are usually prefixed with an underscore _

protected fields can be accessed from methods of an inherited class

### **read-only**

setting a property at creation and never modifiying it, only a getter should be set for the function

### **private properties**
        
a proposal is finished almost implemented in the standard, not supported by engines, may require polyfill

privates should start with #

only accessible inside the class
        
#property
#method

private fields don't clash with public fields

protected fields are more flexible, yet not supported in the language level

bracket notation to access a private property doesn't work this[#private]

## **EXTENDING BUILT-IN CLASSES**

built-in classes are extendable too

built-in methods return new objects based on the inherited type that extends the built-in class (Array, Date, Error)

### **Symbol.species**

returns the constructor that js will use internally to create new entities

```js
static get [Symbol.species]() {
  return Built-in;
}
```

no static inheritance in buil-ins

native classes extend each other

both static and non-static methods are inherited normally

built-in classes don't inherit static methods

Array and Date inherit from Object but Array.[[Prototype]] doesn't reference Object, so there's no Object static methods in Arrays
    
only Date.prototype inherits from Object.prototype

## **CLASS CHECKING: INSTANCEOF**

    instanceof operator checks if an object belongs to a certain class
    takes inheritance into account

    used for polymorphic functions that treats arguments differently depending on their type

### **syntax**

`obj instanceof Class`
returns true if obj belongs to Class
    
works with constructor functions too

`new Class() instance of Class`
        
built-in classes too

`arr instanceof Array`

`arr instanceof Object`

### **static method Symbol.hasInstance**
if this static method exists, calling it like

`Classs[Symbol.hasInstance](obj)`

obj.\__proto__ === Class.prototype  

obj.\__proto__.\__proto__ === Class.prototype

### **objA.isPrototypeOf(objB)**

returns true if objA is in the chain of prototypes of objB
    
## **MIXINS**

objects inherit from a single object

a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without needing to inherit from the class

javascript doesn't allow multiple inheritance, but mixins can be implemented, to copy methods into prototypes.
