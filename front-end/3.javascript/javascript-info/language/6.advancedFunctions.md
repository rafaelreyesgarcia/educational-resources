## **RECURSION AND STACK**

### **recursion**

programming pattern

splits a task into multiple simpler tasks when a function calls itself

**base of recursion**  
            
immediately produces the obvious result  
`x**n = x * x**n-1`  
recursive step  
transforms the task into a simpler action  

a function calls itself recursively until base of recursion

recursive solutions are shorter than iterative ones

**recursion depth**  
            
the number of nested calls

max number of js engine is 10,000  

equals to the number of context in the stack

context takes memory
        
### **exececution context and stack**

information about the process of execution of a running function.

internal data structure containing details about the execution of a function.

a function call has one execution context associated with it.

**function makes a nested call**

1. current function is stopped
2. execution context is saved in execution context stack
3. nested call executes
4. nested call ends, previous execution context is retrieve from the stack, and outer function is resumed 
        
context { variable: value, variable: value, at line where it starts}

context {variable: value, variable: value, at line where a nested call starts}

any recursion can be rewritten as a loop
            
a loop-based algorithm is more memory-saving

iterative thinking uses a single context 

when branches are intricate and recursive subcalls depend on conditions and merging results, optimizing through iteration is not worth it.

recursion can give shorter code 
        
recursion traversals
    
### **recursive structures**
        
a data structure that replicates itself in parts

HTML document is a recursive structure

HTML tags contain
- text
- HTML comments
- other nested tags
    
### **linked list**

storing objects in arrays has problems

delete and insert operations are expensive

unshift renumbers all elements to make room for a new obj, same as shift

push/pop are cheap as they don't require to reorganize the whole array

recursively defined as an object

***value***  
***next***   
property referencing the next linked list, or null if its the end
            
there's no mass renumbering, elements are rearranged separately.

we can't access an element by its number though in linked lists.

useful when we need a queue or deque

enhancing linked lists

- prev property references the previous element (object)
- next property references the next element
- tail variable references the last element of the list, can be updated when adding and removing elements from the end

### **summary**     
        
basic premise of recurssion, is to split a task into simpler multiple tasks (recursion steps)

the task becomes so simple that the function stops making further calls.

recursive-defined data structure can be defined using itself.

linkedlist is a recursive-defined data structure.

trees like HTML element trees are naturally recursive  
branches with branches with branches
    
any recursive function can become  an iterable loop

## **REST PARAMETERS AND SPREAD SYNTAX**

built-in functions support arbitrary amounts of arguments

- Math.max(arg1, arg2, ..., argN) returns the greatest argument
- Object.assign(dest, src1, ..., srcN) copies properties from src1...N into dest
    
**...**  
gather remaining parameters into an array

`...array`

must be used at the end (gather remanining)

### **arguments variable**

special array-like object that contains all arguments by their index.

only way to gather all arguments of a function in the past prior to the rest syntax.

array methods aren't supported is just array-like 

you can't gather partial arguments

arrow functions don't have the arguments object, it takes them from the outer function

arrow functions don't have their own this
        
### **spread syntax**

does the reverse of rest.

it expands an iterable object, into a list of arguments for a function.

spread syntax internally uses iterators to gather elements, the same way a for..of loop does.

**Array.from**  

converts an iterable into an array
does the same as ...spread syntax

operates on both array-likes and iterables
spread syntax only operates on iterables
        
this one is more universal than spread syntax to turn something into an array
        
## **VARIABLE SCOPE, CLOSURE**

a function can be 
- created at any moment
- passed as an argument
- called from a different place of code later
    
### **code blocks****

a variable that is declared in a code block, is only visible inside the code block.
    
### **for constructs (if, for, while)**

variables declared in the code block are only visible inside of it.
    
### **nested functions**

a function is nested when created inside another function.
        
can be returned as a 
- property of a new object
- or as a result 
        
### **lexical environment**

- variables
- functions
- code blocks
- and the script as a whole

have an internal hidden object known as the lexical environment

### **environment record**
            
object storing all local variables as properties  
and stores the value of this

        
reference to the outer lexical environment

global variables don't have an outer lexical environment

lexical environment at execution

execution starts - variable: uninitialized

```js
functionName: function
let variable; // variable: undefined
variable = 'string'; variable: 'string'
variable = 'another'; variable: 'another'
function functionName(arg) {return globalVariable + arg}
functionCall('string') local arg: 'string'
```
        
the lexical environment is pre-populated during compile (parsing) time.

the lexical environment is a specification object, it doesn't exist, we can't manipulate this object

javascript engines may optimize the lexical enviroment object

discarding variables that are unused to save memory, etc

**function declaration**  

- a function is also a value
- function declaration is instantly fully initialized
- function declaration is parsed before execution time
- function expressions aren't pre-populated at run time

**inner and outer lexical environments**

if code wants to access a variable,

it starts to search for it local, then outer, and so on until reaching global scope

in strict mode, there's an error if the variable isn't found anywhere

without use strict, assignment to a non-existing variable creates a new global variable
        
**returning a function**

**lexical environment stack**

null
global
local
nestedFunction(){[[Environment]]}

nested functions will remember what lexical environment in which they're made
            
nested function doesn't run just gets created

global variable stores a function

globalVar = functionName();

globalVar{[[Environment]]} references the functionName lexical environment

at run time, when globalVar() is called,a new lexical environment is created, the code executes, looks for variables needed, the new call lexical environment is empty as nothing was declared during compile time, this is a call, they execute at run time.

js uses the Environment to find the variables needed to execute the code in the call then the call has the variables needed to execute,

variables are modified in the lexical environment where they exist

**`{[[Environment]]}`**

all funcntions have this hidden property
                            
keeps reference of the lexical environment where it was created

no matter where a function is called during run time,
                
(globally, locally, nested)

the function references the lexical environment with all declarations parsed at compile time

a global variable calls a local function

globalVar = functionName();  
globalVariable{[[environment]]}  

keeps a reference of the local lexical environment of functionName()
                    
### **closure**

a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them

in javascript, all functions are naturally closures
>exception being the new Function syntax
        
automatically remember where they are created using [[Environment]]
    
### **garbage collection**

lexical environment is removed from memory after the function call finishes

a lexical environment dies when it becomes unreachable

it exists only while there's at least one nested function referencing it

### **engine optimizations**

V8 chrome, edge opera
        
optimize by analyzing variable usage, if an outer variable is not used, it is removed

these variables become unavailable to debug in chrome
            
## **OLD VAR**

var has no block scope

var is either 
- function scoped
- global scoped

vars are visible through code blocks 

if a code block is inside a function
- var becomes local, only accessible inside the function code block

back in time, code blocks had no lexical environments
var is a remnant of that

var can be redeclared

`SyntaxError` if we redeclared a let variable

var declarations are processed while parsing the script,
defined from the beginning of the function no matter where the declaration is assuming declaration is not in a nested function.
    
### **hoisting**

all var are hoisted, raised to the top of the function
    
declarations are hoisted but not assignments
    
### **IIFE**

immediately invoked function expressions

a trick around block level visibility back when only var existed (not let or const)

a function expression is created and immediately called, the code executes right away and has its own local variable

javascript doesn't allow to call a function declaration immediately

`(function() {code block})();`
the declaration is created in the context of another expression, hence it becomes a function expression

multiple old tricks to tell js a function expression

`(function(){block})();`

`(function(){block}());`

`!function(){block}();`

`+function(){block}();`

## **GLOBAL OBJECT**

provides variables and functions that are available anywhere

**browser global object**  
Windows 

**node.js global object** 
Global
other environments can have different names

all properties of the window object can be accessed directly

`Window.alert()  
alert.()`  

global functions declared with var, become properties of global object

variables declared with let or const don't become properties of the global object

there should be as few global variables as possible

**using for polyfills**

global object can be used to check if a built-in object exists (like the promise object)

```js
if (!window.Promise) {
  window.Promise = custom implementation (polyfill)
}
```

## **FUNCTION OBJECT NFE**

a function in js is a value

every value has a type

the type of a function is object
    
### **name property

a function name is accessible through the name property

```js
functionName.name: functionName
```

name assigning logic assigns the correct name to a function

in function expressions 
```js
let functionName = function(){block}

// default values
function functionName(nestedFunction = function() {/*nestedBlock*/}) {/*block*/}
```
        
**contextual name**

if the function doesn't provide a name, it will grab it from the context
        
object methods also have name properties

taken from the function definition, if there's none

js guesses it from the context (assignment)

name is used to reference itself, for recursive calls

### **length property**
      
returns the number of function parameters

rest parameters are not counted 
    
**polymorphism**

treating arguments differently depending on their type
    
### **custom properties

a property and a variable are two unrelated things
    
### **named function expressions NFE

function expressions with a name

```js
let variableName = function(arg){block}

let variableName = function functionName(arg){block}
```
naming a function expression allows to reference itself

the name is not visible outside of the function

in a nested call, sometimes the outer code changes, so referencing the outer code in a nested call will be bad

the named function expression is not visible in the outercode

NFE are local, not taken from outer lexical environment, and not visible there either

for function declaration there's no syntax for adding an internal name
            
## **NEW FUNCTION SYNTAX**

```js
let func = new Function ([arg1, arg2, ...argN], functionBody);
```

function is created with arguments and given code block (body)

the only difference with other ways to define a function is that function is created from a string that is passed at run time

new keyword allows to turn any string into a function

### **usecases**

receive code from a server JSON encoded

dynamically compile a function from a template

### **closure**
      
[[Environment]] allow functions to reference the lexical environment from where they are created

when a function is created with new, the environment is set to reference the global lexical environment

such function can't access outer variables, only the global ones

before js is published to production is compressed using a minifier

***minifier***  
special program to shrink code (removes comments, spaces, renames local variables into shorter ones)

minifiers replace every reference to the variable with the new name

they analyze code structure so they don't break anything

if a new Function had access to outer variables, it would have problems with minifiers
    
## **SCHEDULING: SETTIMEOUT SETINTERVAL**

to execute a function, in a scheduled time

### ***setTimeout***

allows to run a function once after an arbitrary time interval

```js
let timerId = setTimeout(func|code, [delay], [arg1], [arg2], ...[argN])
```

a function or a string of code can execute (string not recommended)

**delay**

delay before running the function in milliseconds

default 0
        
arg1, ...argN

the function should be passed but not called

calling the function as argument of setTimeout, will use the returned value of the function, if there's just side effects produced by the function, returned value will be undefined

we should pass a reference to the function, the name without parenthesis(call)
        
the timerId can be used to cancel the execution
```js
let timerId = setTimeout(...);
clearTimeout(timerId);
```

timerId returns a timer Object with additional methods in node.js

timerId returns a number in the browser

timers are defined in the HTML5 standard

### **setInterval**

allows to run a function repeatedly according to a defined interval

the repetition comes after the interval


same syntax as setTimeout

`clearInterval(timerId)` stops further calls

### **nested setTimeout**

alternative to setInterval

```js
let timerId = setTimeout(function name(){code; timerId = nestedSetTimeOut(name, delay)});
```

parentSetTimeout schedules the next call at the end of the current call

a nested setTimeout is more flexible than setInterval, as  the interval might change depending on the results of the current call

**usecase**

service sending requests to a server every 5 seconds, if the server is overloaded, the interval should be longer

nested setTimeout guarantees a fixed delay

setInterval is less than the defined delay because the internal scheduler of the engine will run every ms set in delay
    
### **garbage collection and setInterval setTimeout callback**

functions passed in setInterval and setTimeout are internally referenced by the scheduler.

prevents the function to be garbage collected

clearInterval is the only way to remove a setInterval out of memory

a function references the outer lexical environment, so while it lives, the variables too,

lexical environment references might take more memory than the function itself

### **zero delay setTimeout**
        
`setTimeout(func, 0)`

`setTimeout(func)`

schedules execution of func as soon as possible, after the currently executing script completes,

## **DECORATORS AND FORWARDING CALL/APPLY**

### **transparent caching**

if a function is called often, caching (remembering) the results avoids spending extra time recaulculating the result in every call.

instead of adding this functionality in the function, a wrapper is created.

### **decorator**

special function that takes another function and alters its behavior

- cachingDecorator is reusable
- caching logic is separate
- multiple decorators can be combined
    
## **FUNCTION BINDING**

### **losing this keyword**

when a method is passed somewhere separate from the object, this is lost

### **in-browser this=window**

node.js this=timer object

this.firstName becomes window.firstName

doesn't exist so it becomes undefined

### **solution - wrapper**

a wrapper will give setTimeout an outer lexical environment to call a method normally without returning undefined

but if the wrapper changes value before the delay trigers setTimeout, setTimeout will trigger the new value and never trigger the original

### **solution - bind**

all functions have a built-in method bind

`let boundFunc = func.bind(context);`

this=context
    
### **bindAll**

binds all object methods in a loop

```js
for (let key in user) {
  if (typeof user[key] == 'function') {
    user[key] = user[key].bind(user);
  }
}
```

### **partial functions**
        
arguments can also be bind

let bound = func.bind(context, [arg1], [arg2], ...[argN])

**null as context**  
this isn't used but bind method requires it, so null is set

the arguments defined are bound to the function

**usecase for partial functions**  
create independent function with a readable name, fixing an argument to it

when we want a less universal(generic, global) variant of a function

## **ARROW FUNCTIONS REVISITED**

javascript is full of situations where a small function has to execute somewhere else without leaving their current context 
    

forEach(func) is executed by forEach for every array item

setTimeout(func) func is executed by the buillt-in scheduler

### **CORE JS**

create a function to pass it somewhere else

### **arrow functions have no this**

if this is accessed, is taken from the outside, not the arrow function

### **arrow functions can't run with new**

not having this, means can't be used as constructors

the lookup for this is made the same way as regular variable search, in the outer lexical environment
    
### **arrow functions have no arguments**

arrow functions have no arguments variable
