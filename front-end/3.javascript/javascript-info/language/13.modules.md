# Modules

## **MODULES**

in the past, javascript didn't have a language-level module syntax

scripts were small and simple

as they became complex, developers came up with different module syntaxes


- AMD  
module system implemented by require.js

- CommonJS  
created for Node.js server

- UMD  
compatible with AMD and CommonJS
        
a module is a file, a script is a module

### **module directives**

**export**  
labels variables and functions that should be accessed outside from the current file(module)

**import**  
allows to import functionality from other modules(files)
        
in an HTML document the script should have a type attribute with the value of module

### **core module features**

always 'use strict'

each module has its own top-level scope

variables and functions from a module, are not seen in other scripts

two scripts in an HTML document, with a type="module" will have their own top-level scope

in the browser, you can make a variable window-level, by assigning it to a window property (not best practice)

module code is only evaluated the first time is imported (to multiple modules)

if a module code has side-effects (console.log) importing it multiple times, will only trigger the side-effects once

top-level module should be used for initialization

if code should be called multiple times, then we should export it as a function

changes made in a module, will reflect in another module if both import the same code

a module exports functionality (configuration object)

the first import, we initialize it, and write to its properties (top-level script)
further imports use the module 

**exporting module**

```js
export let config = { };

export function sayHi() {
  console.log(`ready to serve, ${config.user}`);
} 
```

**importing module**
        
```js
import {config} from './exportingModule.js';
config.user = 'Pete';
```

`import.meta`
object containing information about the current module  
contents depend on the environment
        
in a module, this is undefined

top-level script this is a global object

**modules are deferred**

downloading external module scripts doesn't block HTML, they load in parallel with other resources

module scripts wait for the HTML document to be fully ready and then run

as a result, module scripts always see the fully loaded HTML-page, including HTML elements below them

loading indicators are placed so the users of the website know the javascript application (interactivity) isn't ready yet

top-level scripts run immediately

async attribute only works on external non-module scripts

async scripts run immediately when ready, independent of other scripts 

useful for counters, ads, document-level event listeners

for inline scripts, async works if its a module

**external scripts that have type="module"**

external scripts with the same source run only once

external scripts fetched from another origin require CORS headers

the external origin must provide a header Access-Control-Allow-Origin
        
modules without any path are called bare, not allowed in import

certain environments or bundle tools allow bare modules as they have their own way to find them

nomodule fallback for old browsers
`<script nomodule></script>`
    
### **build tools**

modules are usually bundled together with a tool like webpack and deploy them to production server

give more control over how modules are resolved

a bundle builds a single file with all modules, replacing import calls with bundler functions

special module types like HTML/CSS modules are supported
        
other optimizations from bundlers
- unreachable code is removed
- unused exports removed (tree-shaking)
- development-specific statements are removed (console, debugger)
- modern syntax might be transformed to older using babel
- resulting file is minified (spaces removed, variable names shortened)

## **EXPORT AND IMPORT**

### **export before declarations**

```js
export let months = ['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec'];

export const MODULES_BECAME_STANDARD_YEAR = 2015;

export class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

### **export apart from declarations**

first declare, then export

```js
function sayHi(user) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${user}`);
}

function sayBye(user) {
  console.log(`bye! ${user}`);
}

export {sayHi, sayBye};
// this can go above declarations as well
```

### **import**
        
```js     
import {sayHi, sayBye} from './filepath.js'

// everything can be imported as an object

import * as say from './filepath.js'

say.sayHi('rafael');
say.sayBye('rafael');
```

modern build tools (webpack) bundle modules together and optimize them

importing everything at once is practical and convenient but

- build tools remove functions that aren't needed or used, if we import everything, there's no room to optimize
- explicitly listing what to import results in shorter names 
- explicit list of imports gives a better overview of the code structure




```js
// import as
import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './filepath.js'

hi('rafael');
bye('rafael');

// export as

export {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};
```

### **export default**

modules that contain a library, pack of functions

modules that declare a single entity (preferred)

```js
export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

import User from './user.js';

new User('rafael');
```

a module has either named exports or the default one

### **default name**

default keyword is used to reference the default export

```js
function sayHi(user) {
  console.log(`hello, ${user}`);
}

export {sayHi as default};

// same as 
export default function sayHi(user) {/*code block*/};
```
  

### **rare case of both default and named exports**

```js
export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

export function sayHi(user){
  console.log(`hello ${user}`);
}

import {default as User, sayHi} from './filename.js'
```

named exports force us to use exactly the right name for import

but default exports we can always choose the name when importing

> best practice is to named imported vairables like the filename

### **re-export**

allows to import code, and immediately export it under another name if needed too

```js
export {sayHi} from './say.js';

export {default as User} from './user.js';

import {login, logout} from '.helpers.js';
export {login, logout};

export {login, logout} from './helpers.js'
```

## **DYNAMIC IMPORTS**

static import/export don't allow
- to dynamically generate parameters of import
- the module path must be a primitive string, can't be a function call
- we can't import conditionally or at run-time

### **import() expression**

loads the module and returns a promise that resolves into a module object that contains all exports

they don't require script type="module"
