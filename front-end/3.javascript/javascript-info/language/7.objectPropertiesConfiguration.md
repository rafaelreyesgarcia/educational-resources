# object properties configuration

## **PROPERTY FLAGS AND DESCRIPTORS**

objects store properties

### **property**

key-value pair
a property can go beyond the concept of just being a key-value pair

### **flags**

special attributes of an object property

properties, besides having a value, have flags.

### **property flags**

**writable**  
true, value can be changed, otherwise read-only

**enumerable**  
true, listed in loops

**configurable**  
true, property can be deleted and attributes modified
        
`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor`
queries full information about a property
        
`let descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, propertyName);`

***obj***
the object to get information from

***propertyName***
the 'name' of the property

**Object.defineProperty**
modifies the flags

`Object.defineProperty(obj, propertyName, descriptor)`

if the property exists, defineProperty updates its flags otherwise, it creates the property with given value and flags

if a flag is not supplied its assumed false

when a property doesn't exist, the property is created with false flags

**non-writable**  
writable: false
value can't be reassigned

non-strict mode will not throw an error when attempting to write to non-writable properties

breaking a flag is silently ignored
 
**non-enumerable**

methods that don't show up in for..in loops

built-in methods are normally non-enumerable

custom method can be numerable
```js
let user = {
  name: 'john',
  toString() return this.name
};

for (let key in user) console.log(key);
```

setting the enumerable flag to false makes sure the method won't appear in a for..in loop

non-enumerable properties are excluded from Object.keys
        
**non-configurable**

sometimes present in built-in objects and properties

property can't be deleted nor modified

Math.PI is non-writable, non-enumerable, non-configurable

making a property non-configurable is irreversible, can't be changed with defineProperty

cofigurable: false prevents changing property flags and deletion, but it allows changing the value 

**Object.defineProperties**

`Object.defineProperties(obj, descriptors)`
    
```js
  Object.defineProperties(obj, {
    prop1: descriptor1,
    prop2: descriptor2
  });
```
        
**Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors**

gets all descriptor objects at once

combined with defineProperties, it clones an object with its flags

for in loops don't clone flags

for in loops ignore symbolic and non-enumerable properties,

getOwnPropertyDescriptors returns all property descriptors including symbolic and non-enumerable

**sealing an object** 

property descriptors work on individual properties

`Object.preventExtensions(obj)`
forbids adding new properties

`Object.seal(obj)`
forbids adding or removing properties  
configurable: false for all prop

`Object.freeze(obj)`
forbids adding/removing and changing properties  
configurable: false and writable: false for all

`Object.isExtensible(obj)`
false if adding properties is forbidden

`Object.isSealed(obj)`
true if adding/removing props is forbidden

`object.isFrozen(obj)`
true if adding/removing/changing prop is forbidden
        
## **PROPERTY GETTERS AND SETTERS**

two kind of object properties

data properties

### **accessor properties**

functions that execute on getting and setting a value

look like regular properties to external code
    
getter and setter methods

object literal get and set

getter and setter methods represent accessor properties

get propName(){code executes on getting obj.propName}

set propName(){code executes on setting obj.propName = value}

if we try to assign an accessor an error will be thrown

by setting getters and setters we make object methods to behave like readable and writable properties

### **accessor descriptors**

different from data properties (properties and methods)

there's no value or writable, there's

- **get**
function without arguments. works when property is ready (accessed)

- **set**
function with one argument, called when the property is set (assigned)

  - enumerable
  - configurable
