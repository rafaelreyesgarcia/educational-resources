# prototypes and inheritance

## **PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE**

prototypal inheritance is a language feature that allows to extend an existing object with properties and methods

[[Prototype]]

objects have a special hidden property called prototype

either null or reference another object

when an object property is read but is missing, js takes it from the prototype

`__proto__` setting this hidden property in an object, can reference a prototype to inherit its structure

**inherited properties**
properties that exist in the object prototype
    
the prototype chain can be of multiple levels

circular references aren't allowed
> will throw error if `__proto__` is assigned in a circle
    
the value of \__proto__ can be
- null
- or an object

other types are ignored
    
> `__proto__` is a historical getter/setter for [[Prototype]]

`__proto__` must only be supported by browsers, but it is supported in all environments

the prototype is only used for reading properties

setting a custom method in the object, prevents it from calling the method on the prototype, as it exists in the inherited object

accessor properties are an exception
assignment is handled by a setter function

what's the value of `this` inside a setter?

- `this` is not affected by prototypes at all

- no matter where the method is called, `this` is always the object not the prototype

- when inherited objects run inherited methods, they will only modify their own states not the state of the prototype

the prototype represents a method storage

the inherited object makes use of this when the object calls the method, it sets it on the inherited object not on the prototype.

inherited objects can access methods stored in the prototype, that affect the state of the inherited object only

methods are shared, but the object state isn't

**for..in loop** 

iterates over inherited properties too

**obj.hasOwnProperty(key)**
        
returns true if object has its own, not inherited, property called key

object prototype properties like hasOwnProperty are not iterable in for..in loops because they're not enumerable

for..in only lists enumerable properties

## **F.PROTOTYPE**

new objects can be created with new Function()

F.prototype means a regular property named prototype on F

javascript doesn't ensure the right constructo value

prototype regular property only works on objects created with new constructor

every function has a prototype property even if we don't supply it

default prototype regular property is an object with only the property constructor, pointing back at the function itself

to keep the constructor right
- add/remove properties to default prototype
    
## **NATIVE PROTOTYPES**

all built-in constructor functions use the prototype property

when an empty object is created and called
[object Object] is returned

built-in toString  of the Object prototype

when new Object() is called
is the same as obj = {} object literal

other built-in prototypes
- Array
- Date
- Function
        
keep methods in prototypes
    
when creating let arr = [1 2, 3]   
a new Array() is called internally  
Array.prototype becomes its prototype and provides methods    

> all built-in prototypes have `Object.prototype` on the top

`Object.prototype` has toString  
`Array.prototype` has toString

the variant closer to the object is called

### **primitives**

primitives are not objects

if we try to access properties of a primitive, a temporary wrapper is created using built-in constructors 
- String
- Number
- Boolean
        
methods of primitives can be found in built-in constructors, they wrap the primitive, executes and then disappear

wrappers are created invisibly, most engines optimize them out

methods are available in `Primitive.prototype`.

null and undefined have no object wrappers, has no prototypes either
        
we can add methods to `Object.prototype`, ***highly discourage*** to do so

> polyfilling is the only usecase of modifying native prototypes

**polyfill**

making a substitute for a method that exist in the javascript specification, but not on a particular engine

borrowing from prototypes  
- method borrowing
- taking a method from one object, and copying it into another

methods of native prototypes are often borrowed

## **PROTOTYPE METHODS, OBJECTS WITHOUT \__PROTO__**

setting or getting the prototype with obj.\__proto__ is considered outdated

### **modern methods to get/set prototype**

`Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`
returns the [[Prototype]] of obj

`Object.setPrototype(obj, proto)`
sets the [[Prototype]] of obj to proto
 
`Object.create(proto, [descriptors])`
creates an empty object with given proto and optional property descriptors
 
prototypal inheritance has been part of the javascript language since the beginning, but the way to manage it has evolved.

> prototype property of a constructor function is the **oldest** way

`Object.create` appeared in the standard in **2012**

- didn't have get/set
- \__proto__ accessor allowed get/set

**2015 Object.setPrototypeOf**

`Object.getPrototypeOf` replaced  `__proto__` 

**2022** \__proto__ is allowed to be used in object literals 

changing [[Prototype]] on existing objects is discouraged if speed or internal optimizations matter

a string can't become a prototype, only an object or null

\__proto__ is a way to access the [[Prototype]] is not itself the [[Prototype]]

associative arrays lack built-in object methods

object related methods are not on the prototype so they will keep working on plain objects
