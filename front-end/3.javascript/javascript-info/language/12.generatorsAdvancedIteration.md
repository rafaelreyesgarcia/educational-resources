# Generators & Advanced Iteration

## **GENERATORS**

regular functions return only one value or nothing

generators can return (yield) multiple values

### **generator functions**

special generator function syntax

```js
function* generateSequence() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  return 3;
}
```

when a generator function is called, it doesn't run the code inside,

returns a generator object to manage execution

`next()` main method of a generator function
    
when next() is called, it runs the execution until the nearest yield statement

the function execution pauses, and the yielded value is returned to the outercode

the result of next() is always an object

`value:` yielded value
`done: true` if the function code has finished

> function* f() and function *f() both are legal, but function* is best practice

### **generators are iterable**

we can loop over their values using a `for..of` loop

`for..of` will ignore the last return value so to iterate properly through all of them,

they should all be yield 

spread syntax works

**generator composition**  
allows to embed generators in each other
    
yield can pass values inside the generator

`generator.next(arg)` the argument becomes the result of the yield
