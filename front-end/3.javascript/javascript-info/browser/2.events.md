# Events

## **INTRO TO BROWSER EVENTS**
    
event is a signal of an action

DOM nodes generate events

### **events**

**mouse**

- ***click***
mouse clicks on an element (touchescreen on a tap)

- ***contextmenu***
mouse right-click

- ***mouseover / mouseout***
coursor comes over / leaves an element

- ***mousedown / mouseup***
mouse button is pressed / released over an element

- ***mousemove***
mouse is moved

**keyboard**

- ***keydown***
keyboard key is pressed
- ***keyup***
keyboard key is released

**form**

- ***submit**
visitor submits a form
- ***focus**
focuses on an element

**document**
- ***DOMContentLoaded***
when HTML is loaded and processed, DOM is fully built
    
**CSS**

- ***transitionend***
CSS animation finishes
  
### **event handlers**

a handler reacts to an event, is assigned to an event

run code as a reaction to an event

assigning a handler to an event

regardless the method, only one `on<event>` is allowed (can't set onclick in both HTML-attribute and DOM property), 

**HTML-attribute**

`on<event>`  
`onclick`
  
**DOM property**

handlers can also be assigned using a DOM property `on<event>`

declared function can be assigned as a DOM property (property shouldn't be a call to the function, returning undefined) 

markup in inline handler needs to be a call to the function
        
can't add multiple values to the same DOM property 

`elemt.on<event1> = 1;`  
`elem.on<event1> = 2;`
    
**mistakes while assigning a handler**

using setAttribute for handlers 
```js
document.body.setAttribute('onclick', function() {alert(1)});
```
        
the function just becomes a string
    
casing is insensitive in markup, inline script, but sensitive in DOM properties

removing a handler
```js
elem.on<event> = null;
```
    
accessing the element: this, the value of `this` of a handler is the element
  
### **addEventListener**

none of the previous assignment methods can assign multiple handlers to one event

two or more programs (handlers) can execute on the same `on<event>`

**syntax**

`element.addEventListener(event, handler, [options]);`

***event***
event name

***handler***
handler function

***options***
additional object option with properties

**properties of the option object**

***once***
if true, the listener is automatically removed after being triggered 'once'

***capture***
phase where to handle the event
            
options object can be a boolean

(false/true) (capture false/true is the same)

***passive***

if true, handler will not call preventDefault()
        

multiple calls to addEventListener adds multiple handlers

some events can only be assigned via addEventListener

`DOMContentLoaded`
    
### **event object**

when an event happens the browser creates an event object

browser passes the object as argument to the handler

**event object properties**

***event type***
`<event>`

***event.currentTarget***
element that has handled the event, same as this, unless handler is arrow function or this is bound to something else
      
***event.clientX / event.clientY***
window-relative coordinates of the cursor for pointer events
  
### **object as handlers handleEvent**

assign an object (not a function) as an event handler using addEventListener

when an event ocurrs, object's handleEvent method is called

### **removeEventListener**

removes a handler

**syntax**

`element.removeEventListener(event, handler, [options]);`
    
the function passed needs to be exactly the same function as was assigned

- first store the function in a variable,
- then assign the function as a handler in addEventListener
- remove it in removeEventListener by passing the variable as a handler

## **BUBBLING AND CAPTURING**

### **bubbling**

when an event is fired, it first run the handlers on it, then on its parent then all the way up on other ancestors

events bubble from inner element up through parents
    
> a focus event doesn't bubble, some events are the exception

***event.target***
the target element that initiated the event

***this***
current element that has a running handler on
    
**stop bubbling**

events can bubble upwards until `<html>` and the document object, some even reaching window object
    
`event.stopPropagation()`
stops the move upwards, all other handlers on the current element run.
    
`event.stopImmediatePropagation()`
stops even the handlers set on the current element.
  
### **capturing**

event propagation consists of 3 phases

- **capturing**
event goes down to the element
- **target**
the event reached the target element
- **bubbling**
the event bubbles up from the element
      
the event is triggered in a target element

the capturing phase starts by going through the ancestor chain until reaching the target

the event bubbles up calling all the handlers on its way

**the options object**

should have `capture: true`

just `true` is also acceptable

> if set to false, the handler is set on the bubbling phase

in order to catch an event on the capturing phase
    
removeEventListener also needs to set capture: true


## **EVENT DELEGATION**

if there are a lot of elements handled in the same way, assigning a handler to their common ancestor is shorter than assigning a handler to each of them

`elem.closest(selector)`
returns nearest ancestor that matches the selector
  
add handler for the data-action attributes that has the method call

### **behavior pattern**

add behavior to elements declaratively
document level handler that uses dataset HTML attributes

steps

1. add custom attribute to element describing behavior

```html
<button data-action="save">save</button>
```

2. document-wide handler track events, if event happens on an attributed element, perform action

```js
function save() {
  alert('save')
}
let action = event.target.dataset.action;
this[action]();
```

## **BROWSER DEFAULT ACTIONS**

- **click on a link**  
nagivation to its URL
- **click on a form submit button** 
submits to the server
- **pressing a mouse button over a text and moving it**
selects text
  
### **prevent browser actions**

`event.preventDefault()`
uses the event object preventDefault property

```html
<a href="/" onclick="event.preventDefault()">here</a>
```

if handler is assigned using `on<event>` not by addEventListener

false works the same as preventDefault

```html
<a href="/" onclick="return false">click</a>
```
    
**follow-up events**

if we prevent one event, and another one was coming after that one, it won't trigger
    
mousedown is prevented, focus doesn't trigger
  
### **passive handler**

option of addEventListener passive: true
    
tells the browser that the handler won't cancel scrolling

browser scrolls immediately

### **event.defaultPrevented**

boolean property

true if default action is prevented

## **DISPATCHING CUSTOM EVENTS**

custom events can be used to create graphical components

### **event constructor**

built-in event classes form a hierachy

event is the root of the hierarchy

### **create event objects**

`let event = new Event(type[, options]);`
  
***type***
event type, a string like 'click' or 'myEvent'

***options***
`bubbles`: true/false 

if true, the event bubbles up

`cancelable`: true/false

if true, default action may be prevented

both false by default
  
### **dispatchEvent**

`elemdispatchEvent(event)`

runs an event object on an element

### **event.isTrusted**

checks if an event is a real user event or script-generated

### **UI events**

- UIEvent
- FocusEvent
- MouseEvent
- WheelEvent
- KeyboardEvent

used instead of new Event to create a more specific event

`new MouseEvent('click')`

### **customEvent**
    
object technically the same as event but has an additional 'detail' property
  
### **events-in-events are synchronous**

events are processed in a queue

if browser is processing onclick, and then mousemove fires, handlers are called after onclick processing finishes
