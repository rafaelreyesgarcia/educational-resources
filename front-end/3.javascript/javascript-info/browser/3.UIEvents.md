# UI Events

## **MOUSE EVENTS**

`mousedown/mouseup`
clicked/released over an element

`mouseover/mouseout`
pointer comes over/out from an element

`mousemove`
every mouse move over an element triggers an event
  
`click`
triggers after a mousedown and mouseup
  
`dblclick`  
triggers after two clicks on the same element
  
`contextmenu`
right mouse button is pressed

context menu can be triggered using a special keyboard key
  
**events order**

in case when a single action initiates multiple events, the order is fixed

mousedown - mouseup - click
    
**mouse button**

click-related events always have button property

allows to get the exact mouse button

button allows to distinguish between right-mousedown or left-mousedown

**possible values**

- left button (primary)
`0`
- middle button (auxiliary)
`1`
- right button (secondary)
`2`
- x1 button (back)
`3`
- x2 button (forward)
`4`

`event.buttons`

property that contains all currently pressed buttons as an integer, one bit per button

>rarely used
  
`event.which`
> outdated

non-standard way of getting a button

```js
event.which == 1 left
event.which == 2 middle
event.which == 3 right

// deprecated
```
     
### **modifiers**

all mouse events include info about pressed modifier keys

- `shiftKey`
- `altKey` (opt for mac)
- `ctlrKey`
- `metaKey` (cmd for mac)

properties are true if the corresponding modifier was pressed during the event.

ensuring compatibility with mac and windows/linux
```js
// check metaKey 
if (event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey)
```
### **coordinates: clientX/Y pageX/Y**

mouse events provide coordinates

**window-relative** 
clientX clientY

counted from the current window left-upper corner

if page is scrolled they change

**document-relative**
pageX pageY

counted from the left-upper corner of document

don't change when page is scrolled
  
**preventing selection on mousedown**

double click has a side effect to select text

so ondblclick an element will select text in addition to the handler

**preventing copying**

oncopy return false
  
## **MOVING THE MOUSE: MOUSEOVER/OUT MOUSEENTER/LEAVE**

`mouseover`
event ocurrs when a pointer comes over an element

***event.target***
element where the mouse went

***event.relatedTarget***
element where the mouse came from
    
bubbles up from a child to a parent

`mouseout`
event ocurrs when a pointer leaves an element
    
***event.target***
element the mouse left

***event.relatedTarget***
element where the pointer is at currently
  
### **relatedTarget**

property that compliments target

when a mouse leaves one element (relatedTarget) and goes to another (target)

can be null

the mouse came not from another element but from out of the window
  
### **skipping elements**
    
`mousemove`
event triggers when the mouse moves

but browsers may skip DOM-elements if the mouse moves very fast.
  
if a pointer officially entered an element (mouseover event generated) there must be a mouseout event

mouseout triggers when the pointer moves from a parent element to a child and mouseover in the child

browser logic determines that the cursor may only be over a single element at a time, the most nested one and top by z-index

`mouseenter`
triggers when the mouse enters an element

`mouseleave`
triggers when the mouse leaves an element
  
mouseenter and mouseleave are like mouseover/mouseout
    
differences
- transitions inside the element (to/from descendants) are not counted
- enter and leave don't bubble (over/out do)
- we can't use event delegation with them

## **DRAG N DROP WITH MOUSE EVENTS**

  `dragstart`  
  `dragend`

### **custom algorithm**

`mousedown`
prepare the element for moving

`mousemove`
change left/top with position:absolute

`mouseup`
perform all actions related to finishing

## **POINTER EVENTS**

mouse events were default

touch screens became popular 

touch events were introduced still with limitations

pointer events were introduced 

### **pointer event types**

- `pointerdown`
- `pointerup`
- `pointermove`
- `pointerover`
- `pointerout`
- `pointerenter`
- `ponterleave`
for every pointer\<event> there was a mouse\<event>
- `pontercancel`
event fires when there's an ongoing pointer interaction and then something makes it abort  
**cancel reasons**  
pointer hardware physically disabled  
device orientation changed  
browser natively handles the event, canceling our handler  
prevent default browser action to avoid pointercancel

```js
ondragstart = () => false
```
```css
/* for touch-related browser actions */
#id {touch-action: none}
```

- `gotpointercapture`
- `lostpointercapture`

same properties as moouse events
- clientX/Y
- target
- relatedTarget
  
### **ponter event properties**
    
`pointerId`
unique identifier of the pointer causing the event

browser generated ID

`pointerType`
pointing device type

"mouse"  
"pen"  
"touch"  

can be used to react differently

`isPrimary`
true for primary pointer (first finger in multi-touch)
    
`width`
width of the area where the pointer touches the device, default is 1 when unsupported

`height`
height of the area where the pointer touches the device, default 1 if unsupported

`pressure`
pressure of the pointer tip from 0 to 1

if a device doesn't support presure, default is 0.5(pressed) or 0

`tangential pressure`
normalized tangential pressure

`tiltX/Y/twist`
pen-specific properties
    
### **multi-touch**

every finger gets a different pointerId, only the first finger becomes primary, the rest, while primary is holding, will have isPrimary = false property set

### **pointer capturing**

`elem.setPointerCapture(pointerId)`
bind events with the given pointerId to elem

retargets all subsequent events to elem

## **KEYBOARD KEYDOWN AND KEYUP**

`keydown`
event happens when a key is pressed down

`keyup`
a key is released
  
`event.code / event.key`  
***key***
property of the event object allows to get the character

meaning of the key

***code***
property of the event object allows to get the physical key code

`KeyZ`

exacly what key is pressed
    
every key has a code that depends on location on the keyboard

>case matters `KeyA !== keyA`

**letter key codes**
key\<letter> KeyA KeyB KeyC

**digit key codes**
Digit\<number> Digit0 Digit1

**special key codes**
Enter Backspace Tab Ctrl ShiftRight ShiftLeft
    
**auto-repeat**
if a key is pressed for a long time, the keydown triggers in a loop until keyup triggers

`event.repeat = true` for events trigerred by auto-repeat

**default actions**

- a character appers on the screen
- a character is deleted (delete key)
- page is scrolled (pagedown key)
  
**deprecated**
- keypress
- keyCode
- charCode
- which
  
**mobile keyboards**
IME (input-method editor)

formal name for virtual/mobile keyboards
    
**W3C standard**

keyCode 229

key unidentified

## **SCROLLING**

scroll event allows reacting to a page or element scrolling


prevent scrolling 
`event.preventDefault()`

events that scroll  
keydown event for pageUp and pageDown
