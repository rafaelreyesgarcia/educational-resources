# Form Controls

## **FORM PROPERTIES AND METHODS**

form and control elements have special properties and events

### **navigation: form and elements**

forms are members of `document.forms` (named collection)
    
**named collection**

both named and ordered

both name (dot notation) and index (bracket notation) can access an element (member)
    
all elements of a form are available in the named collection `form.elements`

`form.elements[name]`
when there's multiple elements with the same name (radio and checkboxes)

all control elements are found in form.elements

*shorter notation*

`form.name`  
`form[index]` 

form allows an old name and a replaced name as valid but old one returns undefined 

### **backreference: element.form**

for any element the form can be accessed via element.form

a form references elements

elements can reference a form

### **form elements**

input and textarea

`input.value` (string)

`textarea.value = 'new value';`

not textarea.innerHTML

it stores only HTML initially on the page, not current value

`input.checked`(boolean)
    
**select and option**

`<select> properties`  
- `select.options`
the collection of \<option> subelements(nested)
- `select.value`
the value of the currently selected option
- `select.selectedIndex`
index of the currently selected \<option>

provide 3 different ways to set the value for a \<select> element
      
`<option> properties`
- `option.selected`
boolean if the option is selected
- `option.index`
index # among other options in its parent \<select>
- `option.text`
text content visible by the visitor
      
  
### **new Option**

**syntax** to create a new \<option> element

`option = new Option(text, value, defaultSelected, selected);`

`document.createElement('option')` can create the element and set attributes manually

***text***
text inside the option

***value***
option value

***defaultSelected***
if true, selected HTML-attribute is created

***selected***
if true, the option is selected

## **FOCUSING FOCUS/BLUR**

an element receives focus when the user either clicks on it or uses the tab key

**autofocus**

HTML attribute puts focus onto an element by default

when focus goes on, code can execute to initialize some functionality

when focus is lost (blur), some code can run to verify or save the data to the server right away

**events**

- `focus `
called when focusing on an element
- `blur` 
called when the element loses focus
  
**methods**
- `elem.focus()`
- `elem.blur()`
  
### **tabIndex**

allows focusing on any element 

many elements don't support focusing by default

focus is available to elements that the user can interact with
- button
- input
- select
- a
    
by default `elem.focus()` doesn't work on
- div
- span
- table
    
first element ofthe document has tabIndex=1

second tabIndex=2 and so on

ordered elements (accept focus/blur by default) (tabIndex of 1 and above) go first, then regular elements without a tabIndex

elements without matching tabIndex are switched in the documentn source order (default order)

setting tabIndex=0 makes elements focusable but keeps the switch order in document source order

tabIndex=-1 only programmatic focusing is allowed (elem.focus() not using the tab key)

adding `elem.tabIndex` works too

delegation focusin/focusout
- focus and blur don't bubble

## **EVENTS CHANGE INPUT CUT COPY PASTE**

**change**
event triggers when element has finished changing

for \<input>, when they lose focus
  
**input**
event triggers every time after a value is modified by a user

triggers on any value change

**cut / copy / paste** 
events occur on cutting, copying and pasting values

belong to ClipboardEvent class, provide access to the data that is cut/copied/pasted
    
## **FORMS EVENT AND METHOD SUBMIT**
  
**submit event**

triggers when the form is submitted

used to validate the form before sending it to the server
  
**method**

`form.submit()`
initiates form sending from JS

dynamically creates and sends own forms to the server
  
pressing enter on an input field and clicking on an input with the type attribute set to either submit or image, will trigger the submit event.
