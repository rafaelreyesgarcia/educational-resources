# local development

## setup node.js

node.js is a javascript runtime environment.

implements javascript google chrome v8 engine on your local machine

### install node.js

- download and run installer for OS
- typing `node` in the terminal will enable to run js code

node.js REPL (read-eval-print-loop) can be exit at any time by running `.exit` 

### download a text editor

- atom
- sublime
- vs studio

### run a script

create an `index.js` file

```js
// this is my name, feel free to use yours :)
const myName = "Dan";

const message = `Hello, ${myName}!`;

console.log(message);
```

you can run this file typing in the terminal `node index`

### command line arguments

instead of writing `myName` inside the file, we can pass it from the command line using `process.argv`

```js
const message = `Hello, ${process.argv}!`;

console.log(message);
```

the argument can be passed in the terminal like `node index Dan` 

`argv` is an array of all argument values and this also includes the path to `node` 

- `node` is an argument
- `index` is an argument
- `Dan` is an argument

so to access the third argument in a zero based array you would need

```js
const message = `Hello, ${process.argv[2]}!`;

console.log(message);
```

## node package manager

NPM makes it easy to share code across projects.

node package manager is a public registry of different packages (modules) that developers publish

NPM also provides a command line utility to interact with the registry to download modules.

each module can have different versions so if future patches are needed the version can be upgraded

**semantic versioning** is followed

### getting started

- create a folder that you want to initialize as an NPM package
- run `npm init` which will walk you through the process of creating `package.json` 

typical `package.json` file
```json
{
  "name": "newproject",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

install an NPM module

```sh
npm install @faker-js/faker --save-dev
```

that command updates `package.json` to add dependencies property

create an `index.js`

```js
const { faker } = require('@faker-js/faker');
const name = faker.name.findName();
const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(message);
```

run `node index` to run the script

### semantic versioning

each number is separated by a `.` to define a different part of the version.

1 . 1 . 5

major minor patch

**major version**

- upgrades can include breaking changes 
- you can write `*` or `x` in the dependencies property to not care about the major version of a dependency but is not recommended in production environments

**minor version**

- generally backwards compatible
- allowing minor version upgrades can be done with `1.x` or `^1.0.0`

**patch version**

- reserved for bug fixes
- they should not break existing functionality
- allow patch version upgrades with `1.0.x` or `~1.0.0` in `package.son`
