# binary and hexadecimal

## binary

binary is a number system only using `0` and `1` as symbols

we humans use our own number system of choice with 10 symbols: **decimal**

`0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`

- **decimal** can represent 10 values with the 10 symbols
- **binary** can represent 2 values with 2 symbols

### multiple characters

**decimal**
2 decimal caracters, you can count from `00` to `99`, so 100 unique values

3 decimal characters, and it can represent 1,000 values.

the number of values we can represent in decimal is `10 ** n` where `n` is the number of characters

**binary** 

2 binary characters gives `00` `01` `10` `11` 4 values
3 binary characters gives us 8 values

the number of values we can represent is `2 ** n` where `n` is the number of characters

> 256 is `2 ** 8` 
> 1024 is `2 ** 10`

### counting

**rules for counting decimal**

1. start with lowest symbol `0`
2. count by moving up to the next symbol

how to move from 9 to 10?

**character significance**

`09` `0` is the most significant character and `9` is less significant

the further left the character is, the more significance it has in the number

- after `09` comes `10`
- after `19` comes `20`

wraps around the symbol range in the least significant position and increments the next most significant number

- after `099` comes `100`
- after `199` comes `200`

wraps the second most significant character as well and increament the most significant number

**binary counting**

`0` `1` `10` `11` `100` `101` `110` `111` `1000`

same rules apply, the least significant positions wraps around the symbol range, and the most significant position increments 1 higher position in the symbol range

### bits nibbles and bytes

- **bit** a single character in binary
- **digit** a single character in decimal
- **nibble** four bits together `1011`
- **byte** eight bits together `1000 1100`

`256` is the total number of unique values we can represent with a byte

**2 ** 8** is `256` 

to represent all positive integers we can do so storing them in one bit in a byte. including negative numbers can split the range in half and be represented as `-128` to `127`

### magnitudes

- 1_000 referred as **thousand**
- 1_000_000 referred as **million**

- 1024 bits (2 ** 10) is referred as a **kilobit**
- 1024 bits referred as a **megabit**
- 1024 megabits is referred as **gigabit**

`kibi` `mebi` and `gibi` can be used 

`kilo` `mega` and `giga` are used in the international system of unites to represent maginutes of 
- 10 ** 3
- 10 ** 6
- 10 ** 9

`kibibyte` should be used when referring to `1024` bytes

## hexadecimal

traditionally used to represent raw data

it is easy to convert from and to binary

### 16 symbols

hexadecimal uses 16 symbols 

`0` to `9` like decimal and extends 10 to 15 with `a` to `f`

characters in hexadecimal are case-insensitive

mixed casing hexadecimal can be used as a **checksum**

a **checksum** is a small-sized block of data derived from another block of data with the purpose of detecting error that may have been introduced during transmission or storage

checksums are used to verify data integrity but can't solely be relied upon verifyin data authenticity

**checksum function or algorithm**

outputs a totally different value for the smallest change done to the input

if the checksum of current data input matches the stored value of a previously computed checksum, there's high probability the data has not been altered or corrupted by accident or intentionally

checksums are related to 
- hash functions
- fingerprints
- randomization functions
- cryptographic hash functions

### 0x prefix

`0x` prefix denotes a string of hexadecimal characters

`0xd6992ba7b0d09dD088E3522743d890584A2F5ac4`

the actual value of a hexadecimal string comes after the prefix

### converting to binary

each character can represent 16 values, so it can map to a nibble (four bits) each character

- 0 - 0000
- 1 - 0001
- 2 - 0010
- e - 1110
- f - 1111

binary string

`11110100110110010111`

- 1111 - f
- 0100 - 4
- 1101 - d
- 1001 - 9 
- 0111 - 7

`0xf4d97`

hexadecimal string

`0x1c3af`

- 1 - 0001
- c - 1100
- 3 - 0011
- a - 1100
- f - 1111

`00011100001111001111`

hexadecimal is easier to type than binary, easy to convert to binary and used to represent raw data and can display large data values
