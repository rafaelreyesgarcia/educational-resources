# classes and prototypes

## this keyword

`this` provides a function with **context**

a function can behave differently depending on what `this` is

```js
function logout() {
    if(this.isLoggedIn) {
        this.removeAuthToken();
        this.redirectToSignIn();
    }
}
```

the prototype chain is a powerful tool for creating new objects and linking them to a common function

```js
// an example of a "constructor" function
// we'll explore this in further detail
function Person() {
    this.name = "Steve";
    this.age = 32;
}
```

in global scope, `this` refers to the module itself within node.js or `window` within the browser

```js
function sum() {
    return this.a + this.b;
}

// call method provides the arguments in a specific context
const result = sum.call({ a: 2, b: 4 });

console.log(result); // 6 
```

`call` is available on all javascript functions. It will make the first argument `this` inside the function.

`apply` is another method to manipulate a function's context

### binding

rather than relying the context is correct, you can explicitly bind functions to a context

```js
function thisName() {
    return this.name;
}

const newFunction = thisName.bind({ name: 'Ted' }); 

console.log(newFunction()); // Ted
console.log(thisName()); // undefined

const newFunction2 = newFunction.bind({ name: 'Walt' });

console.log(newFunction2()); // Ted
```

binding doesn't change the behavior of a function but can't be overwritten

the bind method can also bind arguments

**binding arguments**

```js
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

// argument binding
const addTwo = add.bind(null, 2);

console.log( addTwo(2) ); // 4
console.log( addTwo(10) ); // 12
```

### implicit binding

**call-site**

without explicitly setting `this` with `call` or `apply` there are rules that define `this` for a function.

rules depend on how the function is called.

```js
// function defined as an object property
const obj = {
    value: 2,
    getValue: function() {
        return this.value;
    }
}
```

depending on how we call `getValue` the result might change

```js
console.log( obj.getValue() ); // 2

const fn = obj.getValue;

console.log( fn() ); // undefined
```

in `fn()` `this` is not the `obj` itself, it becomes global `this`

> without the method being called directly on the object, `this` is not bound at all

**call-site** generally refers to the function that invokes a method

### unbound function

it is helpful to define functions inside other functions.

keeping track of the bound context can be tricky in nested function declarations

asynchronous programming implements this technique a lot.

asynchronous code may run at a future point in time depending on things like 
- animations
- network calls
- user interactions

```js
const YEAR = (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365);

function addYear() {
    setTimeout(function() {
        this.age++;
    }, YEAR);
}

const person = { name: 'Fred', age: 29 }

addYear.call(person);
```

the function above adds 1 to the age value of the call context

the call context should be `person` as we set it explicitly using `call`, however, `setTimeout` is not bound to the same `this` as it defaults to global `this`

to fix `this` we can use
- closure
- bind the function
- arrow syntax

**closure**

capture the value of `this` inside of a function scope.

this allows to refer to a variable knowing it hasn't changed.

```js
// captures the context of this in the variable that within addYear scope
function addYear() {
    const that = this;
    setTimeout(function() {
        that.age++;
    }, YEAR);
}
```

**bind the function**

bind the function inside `setTimeout`

```js
function addYear() {
    setTimeout(function() {
        this.age++;
    }.bind(this), 1);
}
```
`.bind` is used to create a new function from the one we pass to `setTimeout`. The new function is bound to the same context as the `addYear` function itself

**arrow syntax**

the different between traditional function declaration methods and arrow syntax is the behavior of this. The rest is syntactic sugar.

arrow syntax captures the context of the surrounding function

```js
function addYear() {
    setTimeout(() => {
        this.age++;
    }, YEAR);
}
```
## javascript prototypes

helpful to make instances of objects with linked, re-usable functionality.

often compared to classes in other object-oriented programming languages

prototypes are different than classes

prototypes are the underlying mechanism for ES2015 class keyword

`Class` is a template for creating objects.

objects become *instances* of a class when created (*instantiated*).

each instance has its own set of properties referred to as **state**

the class provides initial state values and functions that are copied in each instance.

> javascript doesn't have traditional classes from object-oriented programming, javacript has prototypes

prototypes provide a mechanism to share properties and functions by linking objects together

traditional classes copy functionality to new instances

prototypes form a chain of linked objects

classes serve as a template to copy functionality

**prototype chain**

```js
function Animal(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

const animal = new Animal("Bud");

```
methods already available in javascript environment through `Object.prototype`
- `valueOf`
- `hasOwnProperty`
- `toString`

methods aren't created or copied everytime an object is instantiated, they are shared methods through the prototype chain.

```js
const animal = new Animal("Bud");
const animal2 = new Animal("Lassie");

console.log(animal.hasOwnProperty === animal2.hasOwnProperty); // true
```

how a built-in method gets invoked through the chain
- the js engine looks up if the animal instances have `hasOwnProperty`, not found.
- engine looks up on the `Animal` class, not found.
- engine continues to look up the method on `Object.prototype`, is found and invoked from there

```js
function Car(make, model) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
}

const car = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry');
const car2 = new Car('Honda', 'Civic');

console.log(car.make) // Toyota
console.log(car2.model) // Civic
```

- `Car` is a function, referred to as a constructor function.
- constructor functions are capitalized by convention.
- `new` operator creates new instances of `Car`
- `new` sets the new instance as `this` within the Class
- implicitly, `new` returns this object if no other object returns
- using this is another way to bind `this` to a method. The new instance becomes `this` within the constructor function
- both `Car` instances have the `make` and `model` properties

### adding a method

```js
function Shape(x,y) {
    this.position = { x,y }
}

Shape.prototype.move = function(x,y) {
    // move the shape
}
```

arrow syntax shouldn't be used as `this` wouldn't be appropriately bound

`this` should be the instance of `Shape`, with arrow syntax, `this` will inherit the context of the scope unless bound. 

the function has a prototype object that we can attach methods to

by adding methods in the prototype, they become available to every new instance of that constructor function (class)

```js
const shape = new Shape(0,0);

console.log(typeof shape.move); // function
```

`shape` is internally linked to `Shape.prototype`

### sharing functionality 

`Circle` is similar to `Shape`, except that `radius` property is added.

we'll invoke `Shape` in `Circle` 

```js
function Circle(x, y, radius) {
  Shape.call(this, x, y /* pass arguments to shape */);
  // store radius on this
  this.radius = radius;
}
```

### linking prototypes

```js
const circle = new Circle(5,10,15);

circle.move(1,1); // what happens?
```
even though we use the `Shape` function to store variables x and y of `Circle`, we didn't link the `Shape` prototype

```js
Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
```

after that, the `Circle` prototype inherits methods from the `Shape` prototype

`Object.create` is used to link prototypes within the prototype chain

it can link prototypes with just plain objects

```js
const car = {
    make: 'Toyota',
    model: 'Camry',
}

const camry = Object.create(car);

console.log(camry.make); // Toyota
console.log(camry.model); // Camry

car.make = "Not Toyota"

console.log(camry.make) // Not Toyota
```

the property doesn't exist on the instance, it exists on the object passed to `Object.create`

`Object.create` links objects to share methods

same method links prototypes so new intances will have a longer chain

```js

function Shape(x,y) {
    this.position = { x,y }
}

function Circle(x, y, radius) {
    Shape.call(this, x, y);
    this.radius = radius;
}

Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
```

every new instance will inherit methods

### create a rectangle shape

```js
function Rectangle(x, y, height, width) {
  Shape.call(this, x, y);

  this.height = height;
  this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);

const rect = new Rectangle(0, 0, 20, 40);

console.log(rect.x, rect.y); // 0, 0
console.log(rect.height, rect.width); // 20, 40

```

### adding a prototype method

function `flip` on the rectangle prototype that will switch the `height` and `width` taking no arguments


```js
const rectangle = new Rectangle(10, 20);

console.log(rectangle.height, rectangle.width); // 10, 20

rectangle.flip();

console.log(rectangle.height, rectangle.width); // 20, 10
```

don't declare the method on the prototype before using `Object.create` 

## classes

relatively new feature in ES2015

classes create a new interface for using prototypes

```js
// an example of a Person class
class Person {
    constructor() {
        this.name = "Benjamin Button";
        this.age = 40;
    }
    haveBirthday() {
        // Benjamin Button was a curious case...
        this.age--;
    }
}
```

### class syntax

`Class` keyword followed by curly braces `{}`

inside curly braces methods are defined 

**constructor** is a special function called only once per new instance

```js
class Hello {
    constructor() {
        console.log('hello!');
    }
}

const h1 = new Hello(); // hello!
const h2 = new Hello(); // hello!
```

initializing properties in the constructor is done using `this` which is the instance

```js
class Team {
    constructor() {
        this.sport = "soccer";
    } 
}

const t1 = new Team();
console.log(t1.sport); // soccer
```

### methods

in addition to **constructors** methods on the class can be defined as well

```js
class Team {
    constructor() {
        this.wins = 0;
        this.losses = 0;
    }
    changeRecord(isWin) {
        if(isWin) {
            this.wins++;
        }
        else {
            this.losses++;
        }
    }
}
```

`changeRecord` is a method that accepts an `isWin` boolean parameter that determines if wins or losses have to be added

### subclasses

subclasses extend/inherit behavior from a parent class.

`extend` keyword uses the prototype chain

```js
class Shape {
    constructor() {
        this.position = { x: 0, y: 0 }
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    
}
```

in `Rectangle` custom functionality can be added

`Rectangle` inherits the position property from `Shape`

### super keyword

```js
class Shape {
    constructor() {
        this.position = { x: 0, y: 0 }
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.height = 10;
        this.width = 5;
    }
}
```

when `super` is invoked, this calls the constructor on `Shape` the class that the subclass extends

subclasses must call `super` before accessing `this` or a `ReferenceError` is thrown

```js
const rectangle = new Rectangle();

console.log(rectangle.position.x); // 0
console.log(rectangle.height); // 10
console.log(rectangle.width); // 5
```

### calling super methods

the class that has been extended is referred as a parent

the subclass is referred as a child

```js
class Potion {
    constructor() {
        this.empty = false;
    }

    drink() {
        this.empty = true;
    }
}

class NoisyPotion extends Potion {
    drink() {
        super.drink();
        console.log("LOUD NOISES!");
    }
}
```

the `drink` method in the parent class `Potion` can be extended in the subclass `NoisyPotion` by calling the super.drink method and adding custom functionality

### passing health

```js
const warrior1 = new Warrior(50);
const warrior2 = new Warrior(25);
const hero1 = new Hero(10);

console.log(warrior1.health); // 50
console.log(warrior2.health); // 25
console.log(hero1.health); // 10
```

arguments that are passed when calling a class with `new` will be passed directly to the constructor
