# MySQL GROUP BY

Groups rows in a table based on given columns, into summary rows or subgroups

```sql
SELECT column1_name, column2_name
FROM table_name
WHERE filter_condition
GROUP BY column1_name, column2_name;

SELECT column1, column2, column3, MAX(column1)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2, column3;

SELECT Department, SUM(orderTotal)
FROM orders
GROUP BY Department;
```

aggregate functions

SUM()

AVERAGE()

MAX()

MIN()

COUNT()

syntax for group by

An aggregate function must be followed by name of the column to be queried in parentheses.

Ensure that the GROUP BY columns are also present in the SELECT command.

Begin the statement with a SELECT clause.

```sql
SELECT Department FROM orders GROUP BY Department;

SELECT Department, COUNT(Department)
FROM orders
GROUP BY Department;

SELECT Department, SUM(orderTotal) FROM orders GROUP BY Department;

SELECT Department, MIN(orderQty) FROM orders GROUP BY Department;
```

# MySQL HAVING

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE filter_condition
GROUP BY group_by_column_or_expression
HAVING group_filter;

SELECT Department, SUM(orderTotal)
FROM orders
GROUP BY Department
HAVING SUM(orderTotal) > 2000;
```

the HAVING clause is used to specify a filter condition for the group data generated by the GROUP BY clause.

```sql
SELECT Department, SUM(orderTotal) FROM orders GROUP BY Department;

SELECT Department, SUM(orderTotal) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY Department HAVING total > 2275;
```

# references for operators and clauses

GROUP BY

Use the GROUP BY clause in a SELECT statement to group rows in a table(s) based on a given column(s) into summary rows or subgroups.   

It is placed after the FROM clause. If there is a WHERE clause in your SELECT statement, it should be placed after the WHERE clause. After the GROUP BY keyword, place a list of comma-separated column names by which you want to group the data.

HAVING clause

If you also want to filter your grouped data, use the HAVING clause. You should be aware that the WHERE clause cannot filter grouped data. The HAVING clause should appear after the GROUP BY clause. In the HAVING clause, you can specify the filter condition(s) that needs to be applied to your grouped data.

ANY

The ANY operator lets you perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values. The range of values comes from the execution of a subquery. 

The syntax of a statement that uses an ANY operator is as follows: 

```sql

SELECT column_name(s) 
FROM table_name 
WHERE column_name comparison operator ANY 
  (SELECT column_name 
  FROM table_name 
  WHERE condition); 

```

The ANY operator returns a boolean value following a comparison operation. It returns a TRUE value if ANY subquery values meet the given condition. In other words, the condition will be TRUE if the operation is true for any of the values in the range.

In this syntax, the ANY operator should be preceded by a column name and a comparison operator that operates on the column name against the set of values.  

Standard comparison operators like =, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <= can be used here.

ALL

Use the ALL operator for the same purpose as the ANY operator. However, the way it works is a little bit different. It returns a boolean value as a result of performing a comparison operation. It returns TRUE only if ALL subquery values meet the given condition. In other words, the condition will be TRUE only if the operation is true for all values in the range. 

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) 
FROM table_name 
WHERE column_name operator ALL 
  (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition); 
```
