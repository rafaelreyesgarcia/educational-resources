hash function or hashing
    algorithm that takes an input(data) and returns an output (finger print of data)

    hashFuncntion(data) {
        returns fingerprint(data)
    }

    input = data = preimage
    output = fingerprint of preimage = image

    hashfunction generates a fingerprint of input data
        example1
            a hashfunction processes bits of text
            returns first character of a string
            hash of 'hello' would be 'h'
        example2
            returns the length of the word
            hash of 'hello' would be 5
        
        these examples are not unique fingerprints of the data
        we can derive properties of the preimage from the hash

    hashfunctions that return unique fingerprints of data are useful for cryptocurrencies 

        main features that produce unique fingerprints

            trapdoor
                how difficult it is to reverse the hash function
                how difficult it is to extract features of the preimage (data) from the image (hash)

            avalanching  
                related to the trapdoor depending on the implementation of hash function

                if the input is changed, the output must be completely different

        SHA256 hash function

            preimage - hello
            image (hash) - 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
        
        SHA-2
            set of cryptographic hash functions

            256
            512
        
            near protocol uses SHA-256 hash functions
