systems whose components are located on different networked computers who communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another

synchronization and agreement on data

    time 
        every computer has their own opinion on what time it is
        by the time a computer broadcasts its time to any of the peers connected to the distributed system, the time has already changed

        asking what time is it, can be extremely hard

malicious actors

    intentionally lie about what time it is

computers talking to each other but not in a client-server fashion

client-server
    the server coordinates all the actions (responses) the client requests

distributed system
    all computers fill the role of both client/server

trustlessness

    don't have to trust your peers to act transparently

    all participants are participating transparently in order to receive rewards

    you don't have to trust peers, if the only way to participate and earn rewards is by acting transparently and for the common good

    consensus
        agreement on data, state, value

    authority 
    identity

    trusted actors
        banks 
        governments
