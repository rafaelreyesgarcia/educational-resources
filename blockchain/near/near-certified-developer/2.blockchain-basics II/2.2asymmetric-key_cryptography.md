symmetric-key 
    same key for encryption and decryption
    password protected file

asymmetric-key 
    different keys for encryption and decryption
    public/verify key
        identifier for a secret key
    private/secret key

    first you generate a private key using a hash function,
    then the public key is derived from the private key

    both keys can be used to encrypt and decrypt data

    data that has been encrypted with a private key, can only be decrypted with a public key

    data encrypted by a public key, can only be decrypted by a private key

    key-pair
        combination of public and private key
    
    the generator of a key pair can distribute the public key,
    anyone can encrypt data with the public key,
    only the private key can decrypt it

    PGP 
        asymmetric cryptography scheme
        encrypted email scheme

        all contacts have the public key to encrypt messages to,
        only the owner of the private key can decrypt the messages

    encrypting information with private to decrypt with public
        allows to prove only the private key owner is the one that encrypted the data

        this process is called signing
        its like adding a signature to a document, approving that the owner of the private key, signs and verifies data encryption

    RSA 
        encryption scheme
        modular exponentiation
    ED25519 
        eliptic curve asymmetric cryptography scheme

    encrypting data (preimage)
        outputs image (transformed preimage)
        preimage is entirely derivable from the image of the encryption
            for this to be possible, you need to have the correct key to decrypt it (derive it) and transform it into its original form
