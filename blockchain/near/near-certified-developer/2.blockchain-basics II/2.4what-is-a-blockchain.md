living linked list
    nodes(blocks) are added at the end of the list
    each node points to the hash of the previous node on the list
    genesis block
        there is no previous block

ledger (state machine, spreadsheet) synchronized over a distributed system 

transactions
    updates to the state

    clash of transactions
        peer 1 wants to change a value sum 3 to x
        peer 2 wants to multiply a value multiply 2 to x

        if both happen at the same time, the order in which they execute, will completely change the outcome

blocks
    collections of transactions that occurred in a certain period of time

    each block ensures there's a strict order of transactions, and the state will be updated accordingly

    ordering transactions removes ambiguities and inconsistencies
        forks in the newtork (transactions being applied in different orders)

    establish the order in which transactions should be executed

how to update the state of the distributed system?
    consensus mechanisms

        proof of work
            mining 
                calculates hashes 
        proof of stake
            crypto is used as collateral to show honesty
            anyone that isn't honest gets slashed

            honest
                follows the rules and dictates of the protocol
            
            honest peers can verify if other nodes are being honest by comparing if they have the same synched ledger

            if peers want to use a network, then is in their best interest to be honest to participate in it

            if everyone is malicious, the network would collapse, rendering useless trying to be malicious in the first place
