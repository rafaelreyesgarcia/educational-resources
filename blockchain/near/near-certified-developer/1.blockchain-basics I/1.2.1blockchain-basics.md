1. web3
    consensus
        agreement about history among participants

        decentralized time keeping
            each block holds some data
            a merkle tree of transactions

        ethereum added a turing complete virtual machine on this time keeping ledger
            keeps track of function arguments
            return values and code deployed to the virtual machine as data in each block
        
        modern implementation of ethereum model
            NEAR
            solana
            polkadot
            avalanche

            viable ways to parallelize the single threaded virtual machine of ethereum to increase scalability
        
        decentralized finance
            a model to import the financial system onto the blockchain
        
        primitives in a decentralized stack
            time
                enabled by a chain of discrete data moments
            identity
                enabled by a public private key cryptography
            money
                time + value
            ownership
                identity + money
            provenance
                identity + money + time
        
        blockchain simplified
            a slow, expensive database that can't lie, as long as its economically viable to keep producing blocks
        
        distributed ledger
            single
                one single party can verify records
            double
                two parties have verifiable records
            triple
                twp parties have verifiable records, as well as a public record

        cryptography
            allow us to control a private key
            private key lets us sign a message to claim we are aware of the contents of the message and we verify we initiated the message
        
        decentralization

            figuring out a system that runs around the world without a single entity endorsing it
            replace one trusted party to authenticate transactions

            refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity to a distributed network

            redefines how communicates interact with each other and leverage their power online
            web2 communities are at the will of centralized companies 
            decentralization and web3 encourage users to become partners of the business model
            users are encouraged to participate and shape the network with
                governance tokens 
                    to determine what kind of features to implement
                    how to manage treasury
                    development resources
                DAOs
                
            open source allows forking the source code so anyone can build on top of it

2. blockchain 101
    information thorttling is a skill to have
    being able to identify the current landscape is useful to be able to provide solutions to real problems

    trends in the world
        everything is becoming data
        the gatekeepers of the future are those who control the data
    
    money timeline in the world
        barter
            barter and exchange between people
        coinage
            central medium of metal bars and coins
        banking
            metal stored into safes to receive direct IOUs 
        fiat
            central banks started issuing paper currency decoupled from assets
        cloud data
            paper became data in the cloud storage of banks 

    assets are becoming data
        finders keepers
        physical titles
        aggregated digitized data
        pieces of digitized goods

    people are becoming data
        total privacy and anonymity
        digital vapor trails
        human data points
    
    who controls the data?
        uncontrolled data
        hoarded data
        individually controlled data

    global or local maxima?
        future 1 
            the more data the better
            machine learning builds strong moat and locks in users
        future 2
            control of data is decentralized, returning power to the people

    incentives to decentralize data
        centralization means
            better products
            smoother experiences
            difficult to measure risks
        
        decentralization can only succeed incentivizing users individually to achieve a collective good

        late 00s - closed gatekeepers and aggregators (google, facebook) become toll takers, smartphones created walled gardens (apple)
        late 10's - open distributed decentralized permissionless

    how do we value a protocol token?
        conventionally
            90% of value comes from the application layer
            10% of value comes from the protocol layer
        crypto valuation
            90% coms from the protocol, infrastructure
            10% from the application layer
            because all data is stored on the blockchain, the protocol is what gives most of the value

    key problems
        
        UX for blockchains
            too many steps to onboard users

                input financial information
                buy crypto
                move to a wallet
                enable wallet, back it up, learn how to use it
            too much knowledge required
            no user protections

            blockchain developer experience is poor as well

        scalability
            tps too slow

                state channels, side chains
