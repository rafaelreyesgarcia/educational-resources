building blocks of computation can be used to create effective decentralized applications

hard to create them good for everything,
easier to specialize  them in a certain task

many blockchains can play many roles to create a network of blockchains 

elements of computing
    storage
        file systems
            store blobs with a hierarchy of directories and files
        databases 
            store structured metadata with aa query interface
        
        amazon s3 for blob storage on aws
        mongoDB atlas for databases
        amazon EC2 for processing

    compute

    communications

    mainframes, pcs, mobile, cloud all behave under these 3 principles

    certain specialized building blocks are develop to improve one pillar, but its always a trilemma 

elements of blockchain 

    storage
        token storage
            
            tokens
                stores of value
                a token storage system issues and transfers tokens while preventing double spends

                internal incentives to run a distributed system network infrastructure
            
            bitcoin, zcash
                focus solely in tokens
            ethereum
                tokens as a service to use the world computer (EVM)
            
            layer 1 are low-level networks
            tokens sitting on top of a layer 1 belong to high-level networks
                ERC20 tokens running on the ethereum network
                Envoke IP licensing tokens, running on the IPDB network
            
        databases

            store structured metadata
                tables
                    relational DB
                document stores
                    JSON
                key-value stores
                time series
                graphs

            retrieve metadata via queries
                SQL
            
            traditional distributed centralized 
                MongoDB
                Cassandraroutinely

                store hundres of tera and even petabytes of data with thoughput that exceeds 1 million writes per second

            query languages
                separate implementation from specification, not bound to any application in specific
            
            to generalize applications without any application-specific code, we don't need turing completeness, just a database

            IOTA    
                kind of like a time-series database
