# tree data structures

> blockchain networks use transactions to change state and keep track of user balances.

blockchains use data structures to store all changing state data.

computer science concepts always draw trees upside down.

**node** is a basic unit of a data structure

top node is known as the **parent** (root)

bottom nodes would be **children** nodes (relative to parent). (leaves)

**binary tree**

a tree is considered binary when each parent has at most two-children

`adjective` tree. 

multiple trees have different properties that will describe the tree.

a binary tree is one where the parent nodes can have at most two children.

a linked-list is also a tree but one where there's only one child per parent forming a chain more like a tree.

```js
// linked list

class LinkedListNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

// tree node

class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }
}

```

file systems in computers use tree structures

**tree vocabulary**

**key** actual data held inside a node

**root** the node without a parent.

**siblings** nodes under the same parent on the same level.

**subtree** isolated tree of a broader tree.

when to use a tree

- if data needs to be stored hierarchically
- efficient data structure for searching and sorting data

> recursive algorithms are used in conjuction with trees

**balanced binary search tree**

efficient to search and sort data with

properties
- binary tree
- left subtree of a node contains nodes with keys lesser than the node's key
- right subtree of a node contains nodes with keys greater than node's key.
- each subtree must be a binary search tree

these rules or properties optimize algorithm design by assuring that some data will be guaranteed to be in certain subtree path. 

> algorithmic complexities tend to stay logarithmic instead of linear.

as you increase and pack more items into trees, the searching algorithms to traverse them don't get much more complicated.

algorithmic complexity depend on the growth of the input.

because of binary search tree enforcement properties, search time always remains `O(log n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

data structures should ideally be as close to **constant time** 

Big O notation gives a rough indicator of how an algorithm will perform in terms of an given amount of input elements.

## building a binary search tree

starts with a root node, branches to children nodes. each parent has at most 2 children. it's a search tree because the order of nodes is sorted by the value of data.

binary property
- parents should have at most 2 children.

sorting properties
1. data in children to the left of the parent should be smaller.
2. data in children to the right of the parent should be bigger.
