# function modifiers

`public`: This modifier makes the function publicly accessible, meaning it can be called by any external contract or user.

`internal`: This modifier makes the function only accessible within the current contract, and not externally.

`private`: This modifier makes the function only accessible within the current contract, and not even in derived contracts.

`view`: This modifier makes the function a constant function, which means it can only read the state of the contract and cannot modify it.

`pure`: This modifier makes the function a pure function, which means it only reads the state of the contract and does not have any side effects.

`constant`: This is an alias for the view modifier, and serves the same purpose.

`payable`: This modifier makes the function accept payments in Ether.

`override`: This modifier is used to override a function in a derived contract.

These function modifiers can be combined in various ways to change the behavior of functions and to ensure the desired level of access control and security in a smart contract.
