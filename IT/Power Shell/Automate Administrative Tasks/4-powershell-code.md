# intro

cross-platform task automation framework

command line shell and programming language

manage input/outputs

diagnose errors when typing incorrect code

cmdlets, parameters, inputs, outputs

powershell is caseinsensitive

create a code comment with #

Verb-Noun syntax

enclose strings with '' or ""

double quotes display variable values instead of variable names

`Read-Host` write a message to prompt user for input

`-Prompt` parameter defines the message

input is stored in a variable `$name`

`$` can define a variable and = will store the value

# how powershell code works

program is a set of instructions that complete a task

instructions are compiled in a format the computer understands

instructions execute in order one line at a time

basic programs
- accept input from a source
- processes information
- outputs results

program can be
- standalone
- a script
- hybrid

a programming language allows a human to write instructions for a computer

languages give humans a specific interface to communicate with computers

instructions are code

syntax are rules
- keywords
- operators

`if` `while` `return` reserved keywords that have a specific meaning

operators like `()` `=` are specific characters that perform a task

programming languages can be compiled or interpreted

compiling, the written code is run through a compiler and compiler outputs an executable to run

interpreters, interpret the code and executes line by line

powershell is compiled into **abstract syntax tree AST**, in memory, then run

computer checks code in AST for issues, the computer runs without needing an executable

interpreted code runs until it finds an error
